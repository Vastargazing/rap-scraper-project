"""ML Models API endpoints for advanced rap analysis and generation.

Provides comprehensive machine learning capabilities for rap content analysis,
generation, style transfer, quality prediction, and trend analysis. Integrates
multiple ML models including QWEN for generation, T5 for style transfer,
Ensemble models for quality prediction, and trend analysis algorithms.

Endpoints:
    POST /generate - Generate rap lyrics using QWEN model with style guidance
    POST /style-transfer - Transfer lyrical style between artists using T5
    POST /predict-quality - Predict commercial potential using ensemble models
    POST /analyze-trends - Analyze current trends and forecast future patterns

The ML pipeline supports:
- Creative rap generation with customizable temperature and style
- Artist style transfer for creative experimentation
- Quality assessment for content evaluation and filtering
- Trend analysis for market insights and content strategy

Features:
- Configurable model parameters (temperature, length, style)
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Performance monitoring and response metadata
- Type-safe request/response models with Pydantic validation

Example:
    Generate lyrics: POST /generate with prompt and style parameters
    Transfer style: POST /style-transfer between source and target artists
    Predict quality: POST /predict-quality for commercial potential scoring
