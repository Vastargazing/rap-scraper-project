No, streets put me through colleges\nBe all you can be, true, but the problem is\nDream only a dream if work don't follow it\nRemind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this\nI'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal\nK Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god\nTruthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged\nBut somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards\nYou lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses\nSo many Rollies around you and you want all of 'em\nSomebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry\nI should've listened when my grandmama said to me:\n\"Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga\nShit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy\nShit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga\nOh now, slow down\"\nAnd once upon a time, in a city so divine\nCalled West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga\nHe ",

Where am I gon' get that money?\nI refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world\nWhen I ain't got shit to give 'em, and I'm not with them niggas\nWho be knockin' girls up and skate out\nSo, girl, you gotta think about how the options weigh out\nWhat's the way out?\nUh\nAnd I ain't too proud to tell you\nThat I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it\nAnd girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect\nThen we could make it work, but I doubt it\nAnd I ain't too proud to tell you\nThat I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it\nAnd girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect\nThen we could make it work, but I doubt it\nShe said: \"Nigga, you got some nerve\nTo come up to me talkin' about abortion\nThis my body, nigga, so don't think you finna force shit!\nSee, I knew that this is how you act, so typical\nSaid you love me, oh, but now you flippin' like reciprocals\nIt figures though, I should've known\nThat you was just another nigga\nNo different from them other niggas\nWho be claimin' that they love you just to get up in them drawers\nKnowin' all the right things to say\nI let you hit it raw, mothafucka!\nNow I'm pregnant, you don't wanna get involved, mothafucka?\nTryna take away a life—is you God, motha",

(I don’t understand that)\nThat's a perspective I respect because it's real\nWhat it's like to be nice as fuck but got to stress to pay the bills\nThat was me in ’08, seein' no cake\nNot even on dates I celebrated my birth\nJust did the mental math and calculated my worth\nShit crazy, didn't know I got more M's than a real Slim Shady video (I'm the real Shady)\nBig Boss, less Rick Ross, more like a wavy Hideo\nKojima, they tote steamers around the way we tippy-toe\n'Round crack vials and cold-blooded killers, no reptiles\nJust projectiles from niggas salty you rockin' the fresher textiles\nI seen best pals grow up and switch (I hate to see it)\nSometimes over a couple dollars, more often over a bitch (Ah, I hate to see it)\nI can cap and say that I never scratched my jealousy's itch\nBut thank God I conquered that 'cause if not I'd never be rich\nEnvy keep your pockets empty, so just focus on you\nIf you broke and clownin' a millionaire, the joke is on you\nMoney ain't everything, I never say that (Never)\nBut niggas throw stones knowin' they sell ",

If so, I'll find another use\nBut just in case it's perfect, let me introduce\nIt's Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move\nAn ill-ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school\nStill rap for hustlers and motherfuckers that hated school\nSaid, \"That's for busters,\" then heard my shit and I made it cool\nIt's safe to say that I'm gifted as if I'm Christmas shopping\nI got gangster niggas lining up in admissions office\nAyy, possibly 'cause all the hoes a nigga scraped\nA lot of shit up on my plate, so you know a nigga late\nTo my first class, I'd much rather sit up in first class\nShould I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash?\nWasn't experienced, so nah, I",

Don't know\nI just block out the pain, blow the fuck up, get dough\nSee, I thought that would help me, it turns out it's worse now\nMy girl want her first child, my label won't work out\nMy mama don't see me unless I'm on TV, I pray she (dont break down)\nShe strong, but she need me\nThey killed Saddam, now I wonder who's sane\nHow you ",

Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it\nWe're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you\nDaddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news\nI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'\nTogether ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then, of course, everything always happens for a reason\nI guess it was never meant to be\nBut it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe feel how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright\nHeh, it'",

Forget it\nYou left our family in shambles\nYou expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?\nMay be gone but he's not forgotten\nAnd don't think 'cause he's been out the picture so long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to",

Maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)\nNow, what's your name, girl?",

I'm somehow now back to the underdog\nBut no matter how loud that I bark\nThis sport is somethin' I never bow-out at\nI complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate\nBut I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt\nEven when you bitches are countin' me out\nAnd I appear to be down for the count\nOnly time I ever been out and about\nIs drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt\n'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here\nBut I'm not a quitter, gotta get up, give it all I got or give up\nSpit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'\nI'm tryna be headstrong\nBut it feels like I slept on my neck wrong\n'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is your respect gone?\n'Cause someone told me that\nKings never die\nDon't give me that sob story, liar, don't preach to the choir\nYou ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep\nNobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer\nWouldn't even take shit into consideration\nObliterate anyone in the way\nI think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features\nAnd try to show out on a track with me\nBut it'd actually have to be\nA fuckin' blow-out to get me to ",

Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba\nSo, bala-bala-bala\nBu-bu-bu-bu-but, I don't compete with nobody\nI just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle\nAnd dance around my opponents, do donuts\nSometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome\nI'm like a sleepin' giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre\nI just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey\nAnd sink my teeth in 'em, and fill 'em\nFull of poison, and make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em\nAnd let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em\nAnd smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem\nI was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him\nTell him why, look him dead in the eye, then waste him\nAnd the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell\nThen swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell\nIn the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls\nFor this rap game and it g-g-goes\nOne-two-three, chk-chk, one-two-three\nChk-chk, one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me\nThere's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me\nEverybody bores me, they're just so corny\nSo at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror\nThe mirror grows lips and it whispers: \"Come nearer\"\nMy darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling\nYou and me were meant to be together, my darling\nAnd if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling\n'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body\nI don't ever want you to leave me, my darling\nYou and me were meant to be together, my darling\nAnd if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling\n'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body\n\"Shady, I know you're in there some",

The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.\nThey say, \"They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone\"\nSo on that note, I'm leavin' after this song\nSo you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay – so long!\nBut at least let me tell you why I'm this way – hold on\nI was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves\nWho made love under the sycamore tree\nWhich makes me a more sicker MC\nAnd my momma would claim\nAt 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain\nAlthough, through the years I gave her her fair share\nI gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here\nShe knows my purpose was on purpose; I ain't perfect, I care\nBut I feel worthless, 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear\nNow I'm just scratchin' the surface 'cause what's buried under there\nWas a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared\nI went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted\nBut I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted\nHold on\nShawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is – at 4, he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.\nNow, all the teachers couldn't reach me\nAnd my momma couldn't beat me\nHard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein' me\nSo, with that disdain in my membrane\nGot on my pimp game; \"Fuck the world,\" my defense came\nThen DeHaven introduced me to the game\nSpanish José introduced me to 'caine – I'm a hustler now\nMy gear is in, and I'm in the in-crowd\nAnd all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now\nMy self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag\nGot a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged\nPlus, I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had\nSupposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack",

Like you work that hard to stay the same\nUhh! Game stays the same, the name changes\nSo its best for those to not overdose on being famous\nMost kings get driven so insane\nThat they try to hit the same vein that Kurt Cobain did\nNo dangers, so shameless\nInvited to the inner sanctum of your chambers\nLow chain 'em as the enemies approach\nSo raise your draw bridge and drown them in the moat\nAnd the Spirit I'm evoking\nHold on\nEverybody screaming they want the old Hov\nBut the new improved Hov hit like Albert Pujols\nEverybody wanna hear me talk that money like Phil Rizzuto\nBut my mind is on Pluto\nBills that I do fo",

It's like the game ain't the same\nGot younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name\nAnd claim some corners, crews without guns are goners\nIn broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us\n.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact\nSame niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks\nIn black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked\nSo hol",

You know shit is rough after you slid\nYou in God's hands now, keep a place for me, kid\nAin't nuttin' changed, still Party and Bullshit\nWe used to fuck R&B Bitches and see who rhyme sickest\nFor every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out\nMachine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts\nYou came to my hood, we was broke\nI wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gun smoke?\nStill on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so\n'Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto\nBut fuck it black, you livin' your life, through your loved ones\nPeace to your daughter and your newborn son\nIt used to be fun, makin' records to see your response\nBut, now competition is none, now that you're gone\nAnd these niggas is wrong, using your name in vain\nAnd they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that\nIt's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you\nJoke with you, happy we on top, the most official\nAin't too many real ones out there, I feel some but doubt they're\nCapable to take it where you took it to\nI missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake\n'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way\nI woulda stayed so long with so much to say\nI had to put it in writin' to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin'\nTellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side\nBut I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by\nYou can't kill nothin' that's Ready To Die\nYou was like God to us in the form of Allah\nStill somehow I believe, we always survive\nBut why?\nStill, we will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\n(Thug Life never die)\nDear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop\nAnd use teeth to bite off beer tops and Pour Out A Lil' Liquor\nYou was more than just the wildest nigga\n2Pacalypse, I understand your style, nigga\nIt's goin' on the third year, since you've been gone",

Your last joint double-copper\nYou gettin' money or you're runnin' from the Feds?\nAin't nothin' over here but 16 with one in the head\nAnd I solemnly swear\nThat all y'all niggas out there got a problem this year\nCan I live 'til my last day?\nHittin' honeys that be na-sty\nGettin' money in the fast way\nAnd I only care halfway\nBut I still can't let you pass me\nCan I live 'til my last day?\nHittin' honeys that be na-sty\nGettin' money in the fast way\nAnd I only care halfway\nBut I still can't let you pass me",

Y'all know who!

Where we at?\nWhere we at? Where we at?\nWe on top of the world, where we at?\nWe on top of the world, where we at?\nAnd five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park\nI walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back (Wolf)\nHurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs (Ah)\nAll was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact\nBunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat\nTeenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it\nHad a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Bimmer almost black\nParked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at\nEarl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel\nSydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt\nBet I'm missing several, but I had to bring that pattern back\nWe live inside a house that says \"Fuck 'em\" on the welcome mat\nDeep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter, that's where I'm at (Where we at?)\nNow, where we at? Where we at?\nAh, Wolf Gang, where we at? (Wolf Gang)\nSwell motions get promotions, to my whole team\nHell, ",

I'm coming back\nSigned to Fool's Gold, now everything is all gnarly\nNow these bitches want my number to get up in the party\nCame a long way from extension cords in the window\nBorrow neighbor's power just to plug up the Nintendo\nWhere the oven's never closed and the stove's never off\nEvery winter so cold, niggas sleepin' wearing scarf\nBut I always tell myself that it's gon' get better\nYou know who you is? You the greatest rapper ever\nSo now the pressure's on to prove that voice right\nSome people never knew they goals, knew mine my whole life\nSo now his turn's up, fixin' up to bat\nPitchin' singles to the label when I used to p",

I got advice for you, holmes\nFall asleep in your car in your garage with the engine on\nI'm playing ping pong with your bitch jaws\nYou the type to have a sing-along in Superman drawers\nI got a redhead ho I call Molly Ringwald\nShe like to take a lot of molly and bring Adderall\nSipping white wine 'til the sunset\nBefore it got dark, she already got naked\nNecked her for a second, then she got reckless\nRump shaker, Wreckx-n-Effect it\nBum, stickity bum, stickity bum, Das EFX'ed it\nLeft her bum sticky, fell asleep on the terrace\nMe on the beat, that's a hate crime\nWith black ink, I murder white lines\nBassline\nWhat's with all the ho shit?\nYour flow's atrocious\nThe amount of weed I smoke is copious\nEyes red like Soviet\nDog, you're on some bogus shit\nThese novice poets are not my associates\nFerocious, but the flows inappropriate\nBut if you approach this, they might call encroachment\nI'm so bent, oh shit\nGot your bitch soaking\nI ain't Clarence Carter, but bitch, I be stroking\nHo, are you outta your mind?\nI tell a bitch like this, \"You are not that fine\"\nI don't give a bitch shit, no, not a dime\nBut bitch, for you, I ain't even got time\nThe sunshine in the thunderstorm\nCatching clouds smellin' like the Green Giant underarm\nI can never cuff her, holmes, I just give her Sutter Homes\nNut all on her butt, wipe it up, then I send her home\nBassline",
