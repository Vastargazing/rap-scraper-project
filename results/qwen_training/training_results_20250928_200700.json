      "model_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze the given rap lyrics from The Notorious B.I.G.'s \"Ms Wallace (Outro)\" and return a JSON structure with specific keys. First, I need to figure out the genre. The primary genre is clearly rap, as the lyrics are a spoken word segment from a rap song. The subgenre might be hip-hop, but since the user specified \"rap\" for both primary and subgenre, I'll stick with that. Confidence is high because the context is a rap song.\n\nNext, mood analysis. The lyrics talk about the mother's feelings towards her son, Christopher, and his struggles. There's a sense of sorrow and reflection on his life, which points to a melancholic mood. The emotional intensity is high because she's sharing personal and emotional insights. The energy level is also high because the flow is expressive and the content is impactful.\n\nTechnical skills: The complexity level is advanced. The lyrics include references to various rap artists and groups, which shows a deep understanding of the genre. The rhyme scheme is complex, with some internal rhymes and varied end rhymes. The flow pattern is varied, moving between different rhythms and tones, which adds to the technical depth.\n\nQuality metrics: Overall quality is 1.0 because it's a heartfelt and sincere message. Technical skill is 0.8, maybe slightly lower than perfect but still strong. Authenticity is 0.9 since it's a genuine, personal statement from the mother, reflecting real-life experiences and emotions.\n\nI need to make sure all the keys are present and the values are correctly assigned. Let me double-check the JSON structure to ensure it matches exactly. No markdown, just pure JSON. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"genre_analysis\": {\n        \"primary_genre\": \"rap\",\n        \"subgenre\": \"rap\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9\n    },\n    \"mood_analysis\": {\n        \"primary_mood\": \"melancholic\",\n        \"emotional_intensity\": \"high\",\n        \"energy_level\": \"high\"\n    },\n    \"technical_analysis\": {\n        \"complexity_level\": \"advanced\",\n        \"rhyme_scheme\": \"complex\",\n        \"flow_pattern\": \"varied\"\n    },\n    \"quality_metrics\": {\n        \"overall_quality\": 1.0,\n        \"technical_skill\": 0.8,\n        \"authenticity\": 0.9\n    }\n}",

The user wants me to analyze the rap lyrics of Tupac Shakur's \"Tupac’s Letter to Chuck D\" and return a JSON structure with specific fields. First, I need to make sure I understand the task correctly.\n\nThe lyrics provided are a letter from Tupac to Chuck D. The primary genre is clearly rap, as it's a spoken word piece. Subgenre might be hip-hop, but since the user specified \"rap\" for both primary and subgenre, I'll stick with that. Confidence is high because the context is a rap song, so 0.9 makes sense.\n\nFor mood, the tone is serious and respectful. Tupac is thanking Chuck D and discussing his influence, which is a serious matter. The emotional intensity is high because it's a meaningful message, and the energy level is also high due to the determined and passionate nature of the content.\n\nTechnical analysis: The complexity level is advanced because of the sophisticated wordplay and references. The rhyme scheme is complex, with varied rhymes and internal rhymes. Flow pattern is varied, as he switches between different rhythms and structures in the letter.\n\nQuality metrics: Overall quality is 1.0 since it's a personal and impactful message. Technical skill is 0.8 because while complex, it's a letter rather than a typical track. Authenticity is 0.9 because it's a genuine, heartfelt communication from Tupac.\n\nI need to make sure all the fields are covered and the JSON is correctly formatted without any extra text. Let me double-check each part against the lyrics. The mention of \"Euthanasia\" album and collaboration with Sista Soljah supports the technical complexity. The serious tone and high energy are evident in the language used. The confidence levels seem appropriate based on the analysis.

      "model_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze the rap lyrics of The Notorious B.I.G. for genre, mood, technical skills, and quality. First, I need to check the primary genre. The song title is \"You’re Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You)\" and the artist is The Notorious B.I.G., who's known for hip-hop, specifically East Coast rap. The lyrics mention things like \"gun-testin'\", \"Coke-measurin'\", and references to violence, which are common in rap. So primary genre is definitely rap, subgenre might be East Coast hip-hop, but the user said subgenre is rap, so maybe just rap.\n\nNext, mood. The lyrics have aggressive lines like \"Niggas in my faction don't like askin' questions\" and \"Death controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all.\" There's also a threat element, so the mood is aggressive. The emotional intensity and energy level are high because of the confrontational tone and the mention of violence and threats.\n\nTechnical analysis: The complexity level is advanced. The lyrics use a lot of slang, internal rhymes, and references to specific terms like \"Sycamore style,\" \"44 in 54 draw,\" which show a high level of wordplay. The rhyme scheme is complex, with varied end rhymes and multisyllabic rhymes. The flow pattern is varied, mixing different rhythms and cadences, like the religious reference at the beginning which contrasts with the aggressive lines later.\n\nQuality metrics: Overall quality is high, given the artist's reputation and the song's impact. Technical skill is 0.8 because while complex, there might be some repetition or less consistent flow in parts. Authenticity is 0.9 as the lyrics reflect Big's style and themes typical of his work, like street life and bravado.\n\nI need to make sure all the fields are filled correctly and the confidence levels are appropriate. The religious verse at the start is a nod to Psalm 23, which is a common reference in hip-hop, so that's part of the authenticity. The lines about \"Death controls y'all\" and the threats are strong, contributing to the aggressive mood. The technical aspects like the rhyme scheme and flow are consistent with advanced rap.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"genre_analysis\": {\n        \"primary_genre\": \"rap\",\n        \"subgenre\": \"rap\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9\n    },\n    \"mood_analysis\": {\n        \"primary_mood\": \"aggressive\",\n        \"emotional_intensity\": \"high\",\n        \"energy_level\": \"high\"\n    },\n    \"technical_analysis\": {\n        \"complexity_level\": \"advanced\",\n        \"rhyme_scheme\": \"complex\",\n        \"flow_pattern\": \"varied\"\n    },\n    \"quality_metrics\": {\n        \"overall_quality\": 0.98,\n        \"technical_skill\": 0.8,\n        \"authenticity\": 0.9\n    }\n}",

The confidence is high because the lyrics are typical of rap with references to street life and slang.\n\nNext, the mood. The lyrics mention violent imagery like \"gun testing,\" \"hitting fanny,\" and \"death controls y'all,\" which suggests aggression. The repetition of \"nobody till somebody kills you\" adds a menacing tone. Emotional intensity and energy level are both high due to the confrontational nature of the content.\n\nTechnical skills: The rhyme scheme here is complex, with internal rhymes and a mix of end rhymes.
