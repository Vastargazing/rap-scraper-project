Shit, Real Bad Man
Bo Jack
Let's get it
One's for the money, two's for the show
Three for the foreign with them blues for the low
Third time was the charm, hit 'em two in a row
One love to my niggas, chuck a deuce for my bros
Second time around, only a few niggas know
Shot him three times, either you a friend or a foe
Three strikes and you out, pour a deuce in a one-liter Sprite
Two stouts, three fours of the juice
Droppin' trays in the two-liter, one-deep in the two-sеater
Countin' up pros in the coupe, answеr on the third ring
You second in line, I'm first string
Fightin' two counts of first degree murder at thirteen (Thirteen)
Shootouts is similar to a two-drink minimum
My nigga Tre Pounds sendin' double shots
Still that same one nigga posted, love to hug the block

Bo Jack, let's get it
I been in the streets so long, my name carved in the pavement
But all my peoples dead and gone, so pardon my behavior
Click your bitch screen with the remote, ain't targeting no strangers
Start sipping lean and smoking dope, was harnessing my anger
So when they sleep, I'm wide awoke, was hard for me to shake it
I ride with DeeDee right or wrong, regardless what we facing
""Can't let these niggas do me, Bo"", the heart, it couldn't take it
I rеad the statement that hе wrote, was hard for me to face it
Keep the money close, never too far for me to chase it
Did some things that tainted my soul, that part of me is sacred
I feel like Sylvester Stallone arguing with Adrian
Fifth of anejo Patron, been partying with Satan
Say I'm controlling, that's part of my narcissistic nature
Left a half a brick in the Rover, parked it on Stahelin
You catch how your hold, from the tar when we bleed the pavement
Stick at your dome, I feel like a archer when I'm aiming
Uh
Roll out the red carpet at the banquet
We pulled off in a 'Rari, pulled back up in a Vanquish
Know they don't comprehend, it's hard to speak my slanguage
Left my passport in Japan, they carded me in Vegas
A hundred ninety bands, we armed and we dangerous
I put my own work in, they chargin' me for maintenance
So pay the service fee, or get murdered for free
But keep that between us, you ain't heard it from me
You ain't heard it from me
In my hood, we ain't Cripping but we rep the letter C
Used to ante up and chip in on the seven, me and B
Lost Gigi last week, I just seen him at the G
RIP my nigga E-Boy, he came to me in a dream
Told me him and Swalley cool and smiling down on me from Heaven
Then I lost my nigga Newt, at his funeral recession
Thought about my nigga Nixie, Troy, D-Boy and Roxie
R.I.P my nigga Craig, E-Lo, Tino and Moxie
Lil' Desi and Whooly caught up with Jeffery back in Cooley
Put his brother in a blender, turn that boy into a smoothie
Lil bro, you know I miss you, shit ain't been the same without you
Since you left us, we been gripping, on the gang, you know I got you
Lil Jean, tell Eric holla at my nigga Dell
Long live my nigga Krill, they found him hanging in his cell
Tell Stevie, Slick, and Tez fuck is we gon' do without 'em?
Only place for us is at the top 'cause we come from the bottom
Used to be with Freddie B and Jacquo, they caught up with his mans
Knock the meat out of his taco, that's how you take a stand
Peace my nigga Will from the Warren, my nigga E from the Ville
Chilly from Shasberry, can't forget Screech and LaVelle
A.K.A Vido Payne, I miss Sharday and Shorty
They took my nigga James out the game 'fore it even started
R.I.P to Mr. Waters, shout out to Mr. Bostic
My nigga Sneaky held it down, wasn't really with the gossip
Gang shit
Roll out the red carpet at the banquet
We pulled off in a 'Rari, pulled back up in a Vanquish
Know they don't comprehend, it's hard to speak my slanguage
Left my passport in Japan, they carded me in Vegas

Talkin' jewels, I know the man, he dyin' broke
Talk the rules, they overstand what I invoke
Lost a few, shake no one's hand, live by the oath
Y'all confused, they told him rare, I tie the ropes
Walked in the shoes, they won't remand if I get smoked
Saw the news, they showed the fam, I lost 'em both
It cost the dues, halos, and yams, but I'm awoke
I'm sharpin' pool, yayo is tan, the China dope
My momma knew days in advancе, I'm not a joke
Hawk or shoot, taped in saran, arrived in boats
Tonka coupе, space in the van, the driver choked
Mobster suits, prayed in the can, my rider spoke
I saw cahoots, trade on the brand, minor folks
Park and view, I let it blam behind the scope
Honor who? I reprimand your liner notes
Them bricks came in a clutch, need a better ticket (A better note)
In the spizzy weighin' up, you know this shit get wicked (In the trenches)
Keep them blickies on tuck for niggas too suspicious (What else?)
I'm a big dangerous, you just a lil' vicious (Gang)
I duct tape the kids and the missus (Kids)
In the spizzy weighin' up, you know this shit get wicked (You know it)
Kill the witness, leave you sleepin' with the fishes (Where we at with it?)
I'm a big dangerous, you just a lil' vicious
Once the trust is broke and all the love is lost, that's when the gloves come off
I'm from Detroit where even plugs run off
Had to catch up with my crowd niggas, forcin' my hand
Was happier when I was poor with my friends
Went to war for my fam, took a score for them bands
Man make the money, that shit don't make you more of a man
Was once a little giant, but now I got this shit down to a science
Was taught to add, multiply, divide the bag, and minus
Clashin' with the titans, hittin' the road, drivin' with no license
Boatload of oranges, traffickin' them slices
Plug got deported, my outlet jackin' up the prices
But I'm just tryna rack me up a M. Bison
Cold as an ice grill, slicker than greased lightning
My only nightmare is a federal indictment
Can get a whole fifty guap for the right pill
Plugged on the trillion watts, check my light bill

Out the milk crate back up in my rhyme book
Walking back up in the school asking niggas how my eyes look
It was just me and my brush
Keep it wavy baby boy, I ain't playing with them toys
You can hear it in my voice bruv
You need to get your coins up
Should've made some better choices
Now you need to make an appointment
The point spread is too high to cover that line
You ain't playing with house money, they'll be in your house for me
Nah homie, the sink in the couch only
And we gon' confiscate the artwork
Shock you real quick, make your heart work
I don't even care if it's a sawbuck, I need to pick it all up
Back to twirling pasta like a real mobster
Mazda MPV, slide the doors off
 leathers all weather in them pockets
Rocking beef and brocs, keepin' knots in socks
I'm on the road not taken where it's less traveled
These niggas know who's not fake and I don't just babble
Rotating, picking up from fellowship chapel
Selling blows out of vacant, bagging up my next satchel
Paint flipping on the Caprice, Everfresh, Snapple
Looked out for niggas in need when I didn't have to
Kept it discreet, shit was less hassle
But when they try to violate your street, don't let 'em trespass you
Ever been in a gun fight to the death battle
When niggas playing both sides trying to fence straddle?
Play the knight to free my rook, send my bitch at you
Push a pawn to move my queen then I left castle
Anything with Michigan plates, they gon' red flag you
Never answer none of the questions the detect' ask you
Who all gon' really keep it G when them feds snatch you?
We need a Slick and Big Meech BMF statue
I been yumpin’ on your DI, burnt out on your bi-otch
I know some niggas off of p-rock got the shit on key lock
Jugging, remixing that re-rock, trapping with that G-lock
Serving J's in the hood like we grew up off of D-block
Catching a clio, slapping on Y-O
Double was thinking 'bout moving back to Ohio
I know some niggas tree top, Cinco de Mayo
Whipping up with that tap, it ain't no cap in my bio
Trying to see how many pallets I can stack on this high-low
I really came up with Bisky, Moe, Shotty and Ribo
Clip full of rhinos in my Rico Tesiano’s
My niecey know Uncle Boldy keep that 40 like a wino
Used to peddle them black mags on my dino
Now we rocking exclusive Bape shit with baby Milo
I make decisions, niggas got to listen
I come from no pot to piss in
We could build a bridge or build a dam
A hundred twenty messages and texts from my Mexican connect
It's gon' be a second 'fore this shipment lands
A bottle of that Joe Got
Niggas get locked then phone a friend
'Cause you know we all going through change like homeless hands
At the Soho Grand meeting my lawyer for lamb
He said we switch up the scam, they cannot foil the plan
It's getting warm outside, weather switching, the trees growing back with leaves
My body sense the money in the breeze
I fell in Burgdorf and lost it
Them Valantino Garavani shoes made spend a soft six
They said the devil bring the summer back crazy

I taught them niggas how to hustle up them pie crumbs

Can never shake back from all the shit that I shook
Neighbors can't say jack, they ain't get a good look
Had to stomp on the smack, get it on the good foot
You a bold nigga, your queen blowin' me, that's a cold winter
Coughin' up the codes to your cabin, she made a slow dinner
Slowin' up my day just to show you you couldn't flow with us
Put my good foot in the goodness, I made a snow midget
Snow-white china, we chop the shit on some gold dishes
Still went platinum, my celly lookin' like old Jigga
Automatic rounds in the window, we made his home whistle
He caught five, ironic, that was a chrome nickel
Chillin' on the throne, I'm killin' rappers in home slippers
Uh, Wal-Mart, cheap ass shits, I'm cookin' fish
I missed if he hid the crack and his cheek ain't twitch
Lot of rappers can rap, yeah, but that ain't this
I don't care about rockin' the charm, these dude's tatted with quotes
Don't live nothin' that they got on they arm
Wastin' the ink, the grams wet, weighed in the shrink
I got a cooker for my trap, he just stay by the sink
I know some shorties in the club that'll play in your drink
Pass out in your crib, and they takin' your link
Gotta stay on point in this evil terrain
Judges don't give a fuck, they just readin' a name
You built from what you've been through, can't take back what I took
And honestly, I wouldn't, because I meant to
(Honestly, 'cause I meant to, yeah, I meant to take that)
Can't take back what I took (What I took)

Scar tissue, what was left from that AR pistol
Sunflower seeds everywhere, look like a shark bit you (Grrt)
Bob Vila with the tool, keep a power drill (It's a drill)
I feel like Meechie, cookin' up in a pair of Forums (Free the guys)
Gucci Adidas with the creatures, tryna bear the storm (227)
Same lil' Moochie off of Belvidere and Warren (Eastside)
I drop a nickel, they gon' smack you by end of the week (DOA)
Another dime, he ain't gon' get to live to see the morning (Not at all)
Niggas out here holdin' on by the skin of their teeth
While I'm at the table hookin' up, settin' dinner for three
All of these starships and rockets, feel like outer space (Yeah)
Foreigns double-parked all on your block, shit look out of place
Before the clock struck noon, I ran up a bankie
Twistin' up a sixty-two, wrist hella janky (Skrrt, skrrt)
Caught a flight on Grand River, had to call Perky
In the spig with my killers and we all scurry
This new shit'll make your toes curl
Brick of him and her, know we got the best of both worlds (Yeah)
Movie clip reels, ghetto Steven Spielberg (Uh-huh)
Curbside service, tell 'em, ""Pull up to the self-serve"" (Pull up)
Good dope sell itself on them trail ways (A1)
Murder-for-hire, had to pick me up a skilled trade
Did what I had to do to get the bills paid (Where we at?)
Pressin' my bunk, daydreamin' 'bout the big stage
This shit was all a blur
It get so cold in the D, I went and bought a fur (Chinchilla)
Highbridge to Vallejo, I got ghetto love (Real stripes)
For sellin' drugs, niggas made it do what it do
Unless you talkin' codeine, don't do medicinal
Nine zips on the scale, that's a two-fifty-two (A quarter brickie)
Cash and carry, I can never do municipal (Nah)
Fresh up out that boot camp clique, I'm the new Mystikal (Stay dangerous)
Still'll rape a nigga village like I came to pillage
Still'll take a nigga face he don't pay his ticket (Real killer)
Hands-on with the bag, know I'm tray specific (Hands-on)
Exchangin' cash for goods and ancient artifacts (Where we at?)
Had a Chrome Heart attack, went into cardiac (Jack God)
Sold him a fistful of beans, that's a party pack
Don't get me started, drop a fifty on your starter cap (Uh)
Started with a sixty, now the bag big as Farmer Jack

Now I take a deuce, cut it twice, put a seven on it
Mafia, what else?
Backwoods full of dead opps, reminiscing back on when I bled blocks
Still slappin' in them same drug zones the feds watching
Whale fishing, bottle full of syrup, I'm in Hell's Kitchen
Press-shifting, spot you with the work, we be deadlifting
Snub-nosed stick dancin', Glock Nina clip hanging
ConCreature brick mason, been known to keep the heads boppin'
Hellblockin', big remote control, don't make me click the channel
Spin a drill front and center field like I'm Mickey Mantle
Middle finger to the Yankees, this to the Black Sopranos
Who broke the mold, lo and behold
This for Emmett Till, wrist dancing
Mr. Bold-and-Cold with the tricky dance moves, strigadil with the finger grips on the handle
Bottle rocket hot, lit the wick on the roman candle
Put the samples out, next day, have all your heads missing
Where squares goin' seventeen like Uncle Grady's son
Playing with that junkyard dog cut with the Redd Foxx
What else?
Backwoods full of dead opps, we was Hell-risen
Max spoons in them lotto packs, got the heads nodding
Slappin' in them same drug zones the feds watching
I know this shit come with gun smoke or a jail sentence
Trap booming, a thousand stacks is a meal ticket
Used to red-roof them brickies, now we hill-top 'em
Still clocking, quick to chip a nigga like some red hot
Still clutching, stuffing Backwoods full of dead opps
This Russian cream'll crush his dream from a headshot, give my youngin a head nod to blow the submachine
Three hundred beans on my nuts, leaving from the rest stop, touch back with a twelve-popper, screaming, ""Fuck you mean?""
These honey bourbons just remind me how we spun his turban, hopping in my champagne Suburban, fleeing from the scene
Hundred-twenty-thousand on my neck, though I'm a humble king
Footballs and Xans, he don't know his pants from his jean
Thumbelina with the LaserQuest when we be jumping clean
So clean, so fresh, had to make sure that the table set
Kept my sandwich bags where my scale and my razor at
Shaving cocaína, double cup of Funky Cold Medina
Me and Tone Lōc on the Warren where they raised us at
Selling big fat monkey nuts, rocks big as Raisinets
'Member selling dope on that corner in front of the cleaners, gambling with my life, I bent back every time I placed a bet
Turn him right back around, he's almost driving

34316,Boldy James,My Double Trigger,"My Double Trigger Lyrics
Real life shit
Uh-uh
Blowin' carbon fibers through my Cartier optics
We cornered the market, got jars of exotic
My car is aquatic, AR in the closet
Known trap star in the projects
Heartless and modest, a couple open charges from Hollis
Ducking the raid van, on Space Jam, Marvin the Martian
MJ dunkin’ on John Starks in The Garden
From Charlotte to Hopkinsville, we got bars and Roxycontin pills
Poppin' seals of purple, quick to murk you for that dollar bill
""How it feel to be the realest in it?"" What my brother asked
Nothin' like these duck ass niggas, sufferin’ succotash
I'm from the strugglе, long way from the upper class (Angeldust)
Tapеd pounds of loud in the duffel, got it double-bagged
Twenty or better, that'll get the price cut in half
Plus we got them 'bows of the ice if you fuck with glass
See niggas reachin' out; all this money, it got me freakin' out
So everything up in the air is up for grabs
What else?
I ain't these other niggas (Uh-uh)
Run up on me, I'ma get to tappin’ on my double trigger (Dootdoot)
We thuggin’ (Grr-r-rt), screamin', ""Free my niggas up the river"" (Ay)
These niggas rattin’, main reason I don't fuck with niggas ('Olo dolo)
I can't, I be done popped up where your mother live at (Yeah)
Before these niggas have me somewhere doin’ double digits (Real life shit)
Don't run my mouth, 'cause I know talk is cheap (Chh...)
Besides, can't let these niggas trick me off the streets (Uh-uh)
It's mine
And ain't no way out, like that Bad Boy album cover
Cops combin' through the 'hood, tryna do more than case a nigga
What happened to that boy? They found him on the pavement, twisted
Blocks roamin' through slums with slabs for a gravy ticket
Droppin' off the bag, knockin' off the tab
If the town too hot? Get up and leave, had to eighty-six it
My bitch left me for the tenth time, she say I never spend time
And me breakin' her heart, I can't pay to fix it
But if I spent a lot of time in my misery and long nights
Just us walkin' alone, would that make a difference?
Or if I dimmed the lights, water rushin' to the shores
And couldn't do nothin' for you but be a hopeless romantic
Would that make your pussy wet or would you get upset?
When you finally realized that we was broke and we stranded?
Middle of nowhere, and all we had was love to feed us
Would it be the same love between us?
Yeah, I highly doubt it (Angeldust)
What else?
I ain't these other niggas (Uh-uh)
Run up on me, I'ma get to tappin' on my double trigger (Dootdoot)
We thuggin' (Grr-r-rt), screamin', ""Free my niggas up the river"" (Ay)
These niggas rattin', main reason I don't fuck with niggas ('Olo dolo)
I can't, I be done popped up where your mother live at (Yeah)
Before these niggas have me somewhere doin' double digits (Real life shit)
Don't run my mouth, 'cause I know talk is cheap (Chh...)

All them niggas on your block just some damn peons
Gettin' robbed for they shines, oh you fancy, huh?

Motherfuck how many grams you slung
Is you gon' blow your whistle when the nigga hand you a gun?
Heard them niggas wanna kill me, tell 'em, ""Stand in line""
ConCreature Boldy Blocks, I'm the champion, uh
Can't wait until my day come, I love to play dumb
Fuck where they from, everything I touch be A-1
Was me, H, and Big Baby up in Juliana
When I would set up shop in hoods, niggas can't come
Shoutout to the Fear Baby, that's my real day one
Big ups to my shotta Top, that's my real day one
Quick to hit a nigga block, unload a K drum
Have my youngin pull up from deep, he shoot like Trae Young
Or airbrush a nigga fit with his paint gun
Pull up on my lawyer, drop a fifty, get the case won
They'll never knock me off my feet, still on the same run
Junkie snorted the whole ten, it left his face numb
New Yves Saint Laurent sneakers cost me eight hun'
Prices on the blues, we don't pay no more than Tayshaun
For boxes, no more than Ginobili for them K-9s
Ain't no more state time after you cross them state lines

Ayy, I'm just tryna make a bag shake
Dropped out, still, I'm doin' better than my classmates
Glock 19 with the twenty leave you half-baked
High speed 'cause I like my money at a fast pace
This is a marathon, you start off fast
Then you weasel in the back, gettin' lapped, comin' in last place
My youngin died in a stoley runnin' from the police
Who would've ever thought that that'd be his last chase?
Playmakin' off the dribble, that's a fast break
Wonderin' who she bank with? I asked her if she had Chase
When we was little on McNichols, used to trap late
When it was fun, we kept the pistols in the back brace
'Cause when they used to search for strap, they only pat waist
Addicted to that drank, fell in love with how that Act taste
We on soon as I get back straight
Need that new rose-gold skeleton AP with the flat face
Soon as I get back straight

Holy Christ and Jesus, Latter Day Saints, I caught a half a brickie
Climbin' up the ladder of success, I brought my latter with me
Double cup of purple so it's 'Rex in that lamb chop
Modern-day version of my grandpops with a flask of whiskey
Sprinkling hashish on backs of white Runtz and black truffle
Eight Super Bowl rings on my hands, look like some brass knuckles
Thirty-popper on your third eye, fuck with my first lady
Stirred the pot, stirrin' stir fry, you know I'm stir-crazy
First eighty K, they tried to persuade me not to murk Davie
Got him out the way around the time I dropped my first Mercedes

Are we there yet?
Still trappin' in the jungle
Still havin' motion, havin' real racks, rich and humble
Cell tapped, no rebuttal, fell back from the huddle
Blow fell on the dorms, look like a gel cap when it crumble

Rumble pack on the machete, four quarters in a O
It's sixty-four in a 'bow, thirty-six a quarter crow
Brick of blow one-forty-four, twelve packs in a bundle

Good dope that's best served raw like Japanese cuisine (Ah)
From my city to Detroit, where we like Magic and Kareem
Body bags in that Pontiac, I took the 90 back with ease, yeah

Game ain't get it from law school, got it movin' blue ribbon dog food (Ribbon dog food)

Well, watch what I do this summer, that new Patek bust gon' cost like two caddy trucks (Two caddy trucks)
I love to talk about it 'cause them bricks was a real thing (It was real)
'Cause the tape in them flakes shining Tiffany teal green (Ah)

I'm on rich nigga shit, now I sit in the back for comfort (Check it)
I'm at the fence bettin' money, I told 'em that I want the under (Give me the under)
I hit a good lick then married a hood chick just like I'm Shumpert (Like I'm Shumpert)

Bold (ConCreatures)
Yeah
I hustle so you already know off the dribble (Uh-huh)
I'm tryna triple-double if not quadriple (Yeah)
Here them quadriplets and dimes go six for fifty (Flip)
Or twelve for ninety, grinding like we in the city (City)
But we in the country shining, down in Miami (Uh-huh)
Spending money, big-timing, sipping Dom 'til I'm pissy
Poolside at the lows or the blue fountain with my bros
Losing count, but who's counting? Nobody knows
But you, I lost count a long time ago
They say power move mountains, I guess I'm kinda strong
And strength come in numbers, but when you talking pros
Straight profit, straight drop it in a pot of gold
Over a billion served, more than nine trillion sold
Had to spot base where I could whip in five dollar bowls
Kept that steel reserved, four oh on me
Nigga, that's my word
In Detroit, niggas scurry and these whores they be thirsty
So we keep them forties with the thirties off safety
Just in case we gotta do a nigga dirty
And beat him to the chase, we'll shoot you in a hurry
Dead in the face, bullets coming in flurries
And we never hesitate to pop 'em like a furnace
And burn 'em, we keep maggies
So don't worry, be happy, 'cause we rappies
They call me Double, 'cause I like to toke goods by the couple
Know a couple of good niggas who got lost in the shuffle
All for nothing, the D is for them Drugs
And the E is for Edgewood, and T is for your Trouble
The R is Real niggas in the O with them Ounces
The I for the them Institutions that they house us in
Silencer with the beam won't make a sound or jam
The last T for them Thousands grands
And all I had to do was put my product in a pack
Ran threw a half ki' in a hour and a half
'Cause he puttin' too much on his and I puttin' no cut on this
Plus they don't like it when it smash
Shit is garbage, and they'll never buy it 'cause it's trash
Game Time Mafia, bitch, we got it in a smash
Ridin' with the mag out, we gon' put it in a stash
Got a hundred-thousand cash in a Foot Locker bag
In Detroit, niggas scurry and these whores they be thirsty
So we keep them forties with the thirties off safety
Just in case we gotta do a nigga dirty
And beat him to the chase, we'll shoot you in a hurry

I'm the flyest nigga walking, the illest nigga breathing (It's going up)
All on a bitch head once she get to skeeting (You ain't gotta listen)
Blowing on the best buds and I got this syrup too (Got it too)
Can't nobody fuck with the Peech (Nope), I'm in my world, dude
I ain't looking back 'less that bitch, she got an ass on her (Got one)
Tell her what she wanna hear I might have to clash on her
My home be the fast lane (Motor City)
Get rich or die tryna fuckin' run the whole game (Whole game)
Peech be the center, dawg
That painted area is where I made my tremors, y'all (Gangsta, nigga)
Pockets got the mumps
See I came from the bottom and the bottom of the slums (I ain't lookin')
Now I got a spig, two pistols, and a pump (Uh)

Watchin' out for the raven, hundred-eighty bands
Two quarter bricks in that empty box of Raisin Bran
Ten bricks on consignment, that's a payment plan
Playing footsie with baby girl, I'm a ladies' man
Man of my word, don't ever let that money make the man
I'll take a bullet to the head before I take the stand

From Sunderland to Hell Block, known for jumpin' the gun

Road-runnin' out of town with that Hawaiian Sophie
No punchlines, cute shit, or riddles

Can't make no bargains on them prices they be tryna quote me
Bust Cuban on my neck, this bitch a diamond trophy
Lungs cloudy off the drank, got me drunk, drowsy
Drunk drivin', quarter tank in that Audi A8

It's a fact I'll attest to, mess around, I'll arrest you
I ain't playin', you know what I'm sayin'?
This ain't the best you ever hear comin' from a female MC
But you know what I mean? (Hail to the Queen)
This MC stands for Microphone Commando
When I command that you take a hand
And throw it up in the air, yeah, just like that
Now chill, and watch me rap 'cause I'm flowin' (Flowin')
Just like water, I slaughter (Slaughter)
A battle, put me in it, I'll win it
The mission is music and rhythm
Rhythm backed by words all in my system
System by techniques, techniques I got my heart in
Heart into the music, music I take part in
One tribe, one God, and one destiny
Just dance for me
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance
Dance
Now understand that you must dance because this is a beat to clap to
My brother Lance said, ""Latifah, you gotta make 'em get up off their feet""
So I put my rhyme to a DJ Mark beat
Ample samples, this for example
Are made by the 45 King, so cancel
Your plans of movin' to the front line
He's a DJ, producer, and mind you, a friend of mine
I hop, dip, and spin with the children
So get down with the sound and you will lend
To let me sing while I bring
Queen Latifah to the 45 King, creatin'
A new style in the name of the Flavor Unit
That's the way we like it, so I'm doin' it
So if you want to know what the plan is to be
I order you to dance for me
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
My voice is your choice at a stage show
I do it for the Flavor Unit to make you say, ""Ho""
With powerful lyrics, I'm armed
To let a sucker step up and get bombed
By a beat created by my producer
To break you out of the stuff that you're used to
This here is the moment of truth
So take the record to the DJ booth
And let's start this, let the beat get dumb
'Cause I'ma shake it all night and then some
People dancin', I can spot 'em
When I take control, you know I got 'em
Stop the music? That's out of the question
The Flavor Unit takes no suggestions
If you're not on the dance tip, here's your chance to be
I order you to dance for me
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music

Where we at?
Bo Jackson
Right here (227, let's get it)
Perfect vantage point
Free Lethal again, the Eagles and Fins in the field
It's pick him or mess him up in this league that I'm in
It's open field day where most of us cheatin' to win
Flag on the play, now let the season begin
I'm the star quarterback, just tryna sell a block on the DM
Win, lose, or draw from all the laws that we bent
Rules that we broke, work that we sold, tools that we tote
Stuck to the stick on the strip, I was glued to the post
Racks in my socks, sack in my drawers, strap on my hip
Never took a front, never turned my back to the block
Trap in the spots, matchin' my dog snaps from the zip
Twistin' up a blunt, still hurt from what happened to Swali
(Like this je ne sais quoi) It's 227 'til the day that I die
Big Griselda, don't nothin' beat a failure but a try
Had a nine-month run from October to July
It'll break your heart to find out that he who gettin' slimed out
Every dream that nigga ever sold, you didn't buy
'Cause everything that nigga ever told you was a lie
And we know the truth, I'm Tommy Lasorda with a pie
SlimFast with the weight, from North Dakota to the Chi'
Sky is the limit from a bird's-eye view
Where the work sky-high and the Perc' sky blue
Where the Sky-Dwellers bust and the birds don't fly
Ain't no such thing as trust and it's some truth in every lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, but the thugs cry too
Seen my first drive-by murder at the drive-through

Folks, I’m talkin’ about the Survivor Series

Now then—
You never gon’ move how I move

I could make some Nike shit look like Versace, you know what I’m sayin’?
‘Cause that’s just me, you know what I’m sayin’?
It’s whatever
I like the fly, hood, gangsta, slick-talk shit",318,,confident,0.900,"""['success', 'dominance', 'street credibility']""",0.700,"{""artists"": [{""id"": ""67gqUXxHedeUGDTxwBzdjS"", ""uri"": ""spotify:artist:67gqUXxHedeUGDTxwBzdjS"", ""href"": ""https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/67gqUXxHedeUGDTxwBzdjS"", ""name"": ""Conway the Machine"", ""type"": ""artist"", ""external_urls"": {""spotify"": ""https://open.spotify.com/artist/67gqUXxHedeUGDTxwBzdjS""}}], ""album_id"": ""2neNj1lj4R6QgEyqwIrXLc"", ""track_id"": ""10BkLHdmUgCkGmOMkzdIeK"", ""album_name"": ""WON'T HE DO IT"", ""popularity"": 13, ""preview_url"": null, ""release_date"": ""2023-05-05"", ""external_urls"": {""spotify"": ""https://open.spotify.com/track/10BkLHdmUgCkGmOMkzdIeK""}}",1690,37,8.594594594594595,conway_the_machine,chill,success,0.700

In the place that I lives'
We gon take this one over to 275 Halsted
384 Stuyvesant
We gon take it over to 155 Morgan
144 Harrison
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
Well it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day in the neighborhood
Can't go wrong, I feel strong and the flavor's good
I'm with whatever comes my way, hip-hop hooray
Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain old Dana today
I strap out, step out in every direction
Glock, TECs, jimmy hats, in case I need protection
So I Land Cruise, pump sounds, play out wanna be’s
A kid in a M3's getting jacked right in front of me
So I play the TEC close, my finger's on the trigger
Don't wanna get wet, so they steps 'cause mine's is slightly bigger
But better yet I'm a threat, so you better walk
Or get sketched out in chalk, 'cause I don't wanna talk
I stay true blue, I'm hoping it's you too
I got the fever for the flavor of a Woo Woo
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
Time to chill, hit the hill uptown, let's peep the sights
Shoot some pool, act a fool, 'cause it's on tonight
I'm doing the knowledge, it's not easy, easy
Watching a cop cuff a kid for selling a clip to a DT
But it's home, so I flex, get pressures off my chest
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next?
Stomach ache, head to Steak-N-Take for a bean pie
Get a Final Call from the brother in the bow tie
I'm where little kids dream and fiend for fun
Lots of laughter moms, no pops playing with her son
I passed by a girl's wake, they say she died at seven
Hit by a stray, but I pray that there's a hood in heaven
Fake brothers claim there's no shame in their game
You know my name, show me a real nigga with a brain
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
You know I gotta give props, I can't stop, without y'all, I'll be nothin
No wreckin', no checks, and no rhymin', no cuttin'
No stages, front pages, no phones, no beepers
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah
I come with the real life perspective and rule
'Cause me and my peoples from around the way remain cool
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day, around the way, around the muthafuckin' way
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
'Cause it's just another day, in the neighborhood
Just another day around the way
I'm feelin good today
I'm feelin lovely-yay
Feelin' good today
Feelin' good today

34829,Queen Latifah,Cell Block Tango (He Had It Comin’),"Cell Block Tango (He Had It Comin’) Lyrics
Dana Owens AKA Queen Latifah, yes, I'm here to testify
No, I gotta speak on my behalf
You don't even know what happened
Can I just tell you what happened?
He had it comin' (He had it comin', comin')
He only had himself to blame
If you'd've been there (If you'd've seen it)
I think that you would have done the same
I mean, imagine, why was he hittin' his woman? Why was she takin' that?
Now picture her fightin' back
Think of the ass kickin', think of his ass flippin' down the stairs
And me at the top smilin', he should've stopped wildin' (Uh)
Now could you picture me tryin' to finish him off? (Uh)
See why I pictured me on this side of the law? (Yeah)
High heels leave holes, you'd've thought I was gunnin'
Now the cops comin', I ain't runnin' (He had it comin')
Girl, you should've seen it, should've bobbed and weaved it
'Fore the cops came, got a couple of clean hits
And word to Jesus, couldn't take the abuse
But I couldn't explain that to the state troops
But you know, girl (Hmm, yeah, you go, girl)
Plus I look real cute in orange jumpsuits
This the story I'm tellin' and I ain't changin' nothin'
I just needed you to know, Your Honor
He had it comin' (He had it comin', comin')
He only had himself to blame
If you'd've been there (If you'd've seen it)
I think that you would have done the same
He had it comin' (He had it comin', comin')
He only had himself to blame
If you'd've been there (If you'd've seen it)
I think that you would have done the same
Alright, alright, let's get this over with, take the mugshot
Hurry up and fingerprint, what the blood clot?
Lil' Kim AKA Sofia Luchiani
Keep your jumpsuit, I'm rockin' Armani
Yeah, I bust at him once, but that was just a warnin'
My lawyer'll be here with bail money in the mornin'
I'm not guilty, just tryin' to protect mines
Ain't my fault he ran into my knife twenty times (He had it comin')
Just my luck the bastard ain't die
What you would've did if, every other day, he blacked your eye?
Broke your nose 'til it started bleedin'
Kick you in your ribs, choke you 'til you stop breathin'
**** that, I'm sick of bobbin' and weavin'
Him threatenin' to kill me when I threaten to leave him
I'll do a bid 'cause ain't no way
**** gonna do me like Ike and OJ
He had it comin' (Comin')
He only had himself to blame
If you'd've been there (If you'd've seen it)
I think that you would have done the same
He had it comin' (Comin')
He only had himself to blame
If you'd've been there (If you'd've seen it)
I think that you would have done the same
This is for the constantly accused, mentally abused (Uh, yeah)
How many of you been in my shoes before? (Alright, please)
Or have you felt you caught the worse case
Puttin' up with his tired ass in the first place?
Why am I flippin'?
I just bought them condoms, I ain't used not one, but there was two missin' (Two missin'?)
Made a new mission, how to catch a cheater
If he only use Coast, you shouldn't smell Lever (He had it comin')
If you know he don't smoke, you shouldn't smell reefer
If you catch him cheatin', you shouldn't yell either
Run up on him quietly, choke him out silently
It might sound cruel, but you gotta love the irony
So explain that, just came back off a trip
And I come home to this
Please, he ain't follow the guidelines
So forgive me, Your Honor, but he ran into my knife five times
He had it comin' (Comin')
He only had himself to blame
If you'd've been there (If you'd've seen it)
I think that you would have done the same
He had it comin' (Comin')
He only had himself to blame
If you'd've been there (If you'd've seen it)
I think that you would have done the same
He had it comin' (Comin')
He only had himself to blame

34830,Queen Latifah,Come So Far (Got So Far To Go),"Hey, old friend, let's look back on the crazy clothes we wore
Ain't it fun to look back, and to see it's all been done before?
All those nights together are a special memory
And I can't wait for tomorrow, just as long as you're dancing next to me
'Cause it's so clear, every year, we get stronger (Stronger)
And what's gone is gone, the past is the past
Turn the radio up, and then hit the gas 'cause
I know we've come so far, but we've got so far to go (Ooh)
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long 'til it's time to go
So most days we'll take it fast and some nights we'll take it slow (Ooh)
I know we've come so far, but baby, baby, we've got so far to go (Oh yeah, hey yeah, oh, oh)
Hey old friend together, side-by-side and year-by-year
The road was filled with twists and turns, oh, but that's the road that got us here
Let's move past the bad times, but before those memories fade
Let's forgive, but not forget and learn from all the mistakes we made
'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger (Stronger)
So don't give up and don't say when
And just get back on the road again 'cause

There's plenty of room, so jump inside (Jump inside)
The highway's rocky every now and then (Yeah, yeah)
But it's so much better than where I've been
Just keep movin' at your own speed (Yeah, woo)
Your heart is all the compass you'll ever need (So you need)
Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on
'Cause the rearview mirror only shows what's gone, gone, gone (Yeah)

Today I'm not the queen, a sista, role model, or friend
Today I'm that bitch that'll shoot you a fair one, this don't exclude men
Wanna test me? Come test your weak songs and weak shows
Reincarnated I'll be a pimp and slap the shit out of these weak hoes
With these freak shows, make em' leak holes
I ain't talkin' about shootin' free throws, coming on stage with no clothes
Shit who the fuck said I can't beat those break?
Took so long for your album to drop, I thought you died I missed the wake
I don't spit subliminals no doubt
This way you don't walk around wondering who the fuck I'm talkin' bout'
I'm not trippin', I heard you rippin'
But I'm into breakin' bitches, sending them back to their first career; Stripping
Lap dancing for five cents, doing VIPs to make rent
Look up and I'm platinum wondering where the fuck time went
This is for those hoes who oppose my queendom and wanna bring some plate
I ain't got shit else to do so
And them niggas too this don't exclude you, I won't duck
Yeah the only thing worse then a bitch nigga is these pretty motherfuckers
Dressing the part with no heart gettin' hot niggas to rap wit' em'
So the fuck what? A lot of wack niggas went platinum
While you on tour your girls get manicured
Better leave security, I might knock on your door and get yours
Don't put it past me, ask Apache how many I left in stitches
Now let me get back to these bitches
I'm sick of these hoes poppin' bullshit on the radio
And the videos like they're the ones with the tv shows
You want what I got? We could fight everyday for all the lotta
Bitches is acting but I'm the one gettin' paid for it
You hoes saw Set It Off
Don't make me braid my hair back and let it off
Cleo ho don't start no, won't be no
Get knocked out not knowin' what a diva do, what a diva did, and what a diva is
Bitch recognize who Queen Latifah is
I'll give it to you raw with no trojan
Your legs are the only thing you s'pose to keep open
You jokin', smoking on the good shit
You get a good kick up on yo ass
Playin' me close like siamese, wantin' to try these
I'm leavin' you hoes and I see you in IVs
Who ever said they beat me lied
Bitch you need to put down the tv guide
Turn off the tv, now you see me, 3-D
Thought shit would be easy, believe me
My name ain't Khadijah, this ain't Living Single
On the Fox Network, you fuckin' wit an expert
Get yo ass laid to rest, I will cave yo chest
Bitch niggas gettin' robbed for they Avirex
Pay yo debts or I'ma be up in yo pockets (quick)
Dent in yo mouth if these bitches wanna gossip
Poppin' that shit about me and don't know my steelo (so what you sayin' yo?)
I make my own shit legit, you ride a dick for dough, ho (so what you sayin' yo?)
I don't need tight clothes to cover up my half assed flows (so what you sayin' yo?)

This one goes out to all the rough and rugged muthafuckas out there
Yes baby
Strictly on the Latifah tip, I'm saying
A Yo they don't know nothin' about this here
Yo This Queen Latifah in the house
I got my man Heavy D, My Boy Treach and My Boy KRS-One in the house
To Rip some shit with me right quick
The quicker committee gettin' witty for many 'cause the war ain't won
This the city where I'm from, I'll glue ya titties to ya tongue
It's on like this switch, It's Big, Big, Big Hit, The Black Bleep, the rip
Smokin' Shit with mad misfits
The one man, one mold, Murder 1
Murder gold, one hard headache to hold
Word to god, it's good as gold
If it ain't rough, it ain't ashy & brick thick
And if it ain't nasty, Naughty's pissin' on your picnic
Rough is the place, the space, knuckle which way you think
Here to put a fat black nose back on the Black Sphinx
I don't shoot the gift, bitch, will slaughter your Christmas
I shot St. Nick and stuck him for the gifts I ain't get
No one under 17 admitted, so I came 18 deep
You can raid but you can't thank.....
If it ain't rough, it ain't rugged
And if you can't hear it, you can't dub it, I love it
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)
Tell me how you like it: rough
Tell me how you need it: rough
Tell me how you keep it: rough
Tell me how you want it: rough
Tuck away your entire stuff, I'm comin' tough
Rugged and rough, from a blunt, take a puff UH
Never joke with a tech nine, hotter than a sex line
Next time, flex when it's my time
I'll take a chump or a champ, a clamp or a zamp, so now the rolly polly holy moly
I'm magnificent
Skip to my lou, gather up your crew
Let the heavy setters show you what a nigga could really do today
We all know about body bags, but seems everybody brags
About being tough, catch a body tag
Knowin' well, they just cream puffs
Talkin' tough cause they've seen stuff, it's a bluff
They ain't tough they ain't nothin'
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)
Follow me massive! Follow me massive! Follow me crew! follow me crew!
KRS-One in the party just a gwan and wanna (ease up)
Here we go, yo, you Know the flow, I get high & low
You Know, why you wanna flow with the pro? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Breakin' rappers in half by the ass is my only task
Gold & platinum plaques will pass, only talent will last
I come to the party prepared to kick ass
You come to the party well prepared to get scared
You're through and need stitching up, you and your crew'll start bitching up
Where you gonna live around where I'm not stompin' it?
I really believe you're a wee bit ova confident
On MTV, you wanna down rate me quick, yeah I'm a hypocrite
When you in my face, you on my dick
Consequently your lyrics don't fit, get a grip
You straight on some sucka shit
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)
Here comes the queen, I'll make a woman on the track get attracted like a fiend to the beat so I rap
You're looking for a friend to the end? Good, that me
But if you're looking for a gangsta bitch
That's exactly what you're gonna see
Ain't no way, ain't no say, this ain't your lucky day
So go pray, now you pay,  'cause I don't fuckin' play
Matter fact, I think Ice-T, he put it just right:
""You diss me on record? You see me? Fight!""
Just throw up the joints and get to the point
And cut all the talk, the BS can walk
'Cause I ain't here to waste my breath
You test my skills, you gettin' put to ya death
I'm sick of all the huff, puff, blow your house down bullshit I heard last week
You get ya ass beat
So watch the way you approach the Queen
If it ain't rough I'll send that ass to the guillotines
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)

Oooh! Thing called Weekend Love!
Tony Rebel and Queen Latifah
I could live with it, baby
You know what I mean?
Watch this!
Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
If you've been misled
By anything I said
I didn't mean to turn you on
The vibe was oh so strong
And you got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Mondays through Friday's out - I'll see you then
A W-E-E-K and a E-N-D
And a L-O-V-E we were meant to be
A W-E-E-K, a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be
Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
Seems it's been so long
Since you filled me with your charms
I tenderly imagine me
Resting in your arms
But you've got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Monday through Friday's out - I'll see you then
Because we're sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that
Once in a week
Sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that
Once in a week
I know, you know
We are occupied
From our own love life
This has been denied
Many feelins high
Many tears of pride
But by the weekend
That must be rectified
Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love (maybe someday it will change)
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
If you've been misled
By anything I said
I didn't mean to turn you on
The vibe was oh so strong
And you got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Monday through Friday's out - I'll see you then
A W-E-E-K and a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be
A W-E-E-K, a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be
When we are absent, that is a  to present
To nourish and cherish every moment
To deliver the goods I am efficient
And I know you're possessed with the ingredients
During the week the days seems to be long
But on the weekend, wish the clock would reverse its hand
Great things can come in a small bag
So let's make use of the time that we have
When we are together, 'cause we're spectacular
As if we never miss a second of the hour
When we are together, I sit and I wonder
If this love is gonna last forever
Well then I think and I start remember
That we are-a just a...

Take this mask off

Okay, okay
Shit

Yes, mama?
Time to get up
Hello, I'm Queen Latifah, how you doing?
I hope that you're with this, I hope that you're willing
I want to introduce you to a cut called, ""Mama Gave Birth to the Soul Children""
Well, here comes the 'Goy (The 'Goy?)
The Tru to the 'Goy
You know the one, the a Dove-like boy
Stepping in a step (Step), keeping with a kept (Kept)
Making an appearance with a knotty-head set
Lunatics you lose 'cause the Plug 2's sayin'
Peace to the negative, nah, you make the weigh-in
Weigh-in (Weigh-in), weigh-in (Weigh-in), way out of order
If you know you're better, you'd better that you caught a
Waving the mighty peace sign higher than a kite
If you're feeling sick, it's alright, it's fever night
Don't go do-si-do and diggin' no potholes
'Cause if you do, we calling March Patrol
It's no different from the verbal last heard
Cayumbo is the ruler that's bond to the word
He's moving more than three feet, rocking with the knee-deep
Dove is going to leave you with a tweet, tweet, tweet
Next on the menu, we continue with the pasta
Dipped in chocolate, served with lots of
Twizzlers and honey, yum, yum, yummy
Lyrics I'm flaunting is good for the tummy
Tiptoeing in, I proceed to the floors
Selling much records like a pimp mover
Excuse me, momsy, Pos wins
Cause I'm the A to the Plug W-O-N
Brother, freak it live for this tribe
Now let's ride down the highway of vibes
Pushing that we start 'cause the soul says please
'Cause backwards, that's rats and we don't eat cheese
Duck sentences need to get my meaning
'Cause preacher is the key to the casual reading
Polaroid flicks are back and you will know
That the soul is moving on up like the Jeffersons show
Go mommy, go mommy, go mommy
Go mommy, go mommy, go mommy
Go mommy, go mommy, go mommy
Go mommy, go mommy, go mommy
I'm back, a Black queen upon the scene
With a knack for funky tracks, know what I mean?
Prince Paul produces this and it's a fly one
It had to be that way, he's one of my sons
It's a family affair and then we're out of here
There's no doubt here 'cause this is our year
So plex to a Queen Latifah/De La Soul sound (Go 'head, mama, get down)
It was inevitable that this joint venture would be incredible
We never put ourselves on any pedestal
But the rhyme is so good, it's practically edible (Say what?)
So check the sounds of Mama Zulu (Mama Zulu) as I relay the story untold
And if you're wondering why I got kids so big, they weren't born from the body, they were born from the soul
Go mommy, go mommy, mommy
Mommy, can you teach us how to rhyme?
Just like the rest of the family, baby
Mommy, mommy, is the tribe really that big?
The tribe is as big as the ocean
Mommy, can we say hi to the family? Mommy, please
Go on, baby
I wanna say hi to my brother Mase
I'd like to say to my Jungle Brothers, Mike G, Afrika, Sammy B
And Q-Tip and Ali-Shaheed Muhammad from Quest, yeah
We have to say hi to our little sister, Monie Love
Yeah, I like that
We'd like to say hi to grandpa
Yeah, grandpa Afrika Bambaataa
And grandma, grandma Omi
And we want to say hi to the Flavor Unit
And the Safari Sisters
Oh, yeah
And we gotta say hi to papa Prop, Red Alert
Oh, hi, Red
We have to say to say hi to our big, big, big, big brother, Prince Paul

Give me body
Mhm
Give me body
Welcome into my Queendom (My Queendom)
Come one, come all
When it comes to lyrics, I bring them (I bring them)
In spring, I sing, in fall, I call out to
All the ones who had a hard day (Hard day)
I prepared a place on my dance floor
The time is now for you to party
I thought it would be a good chance for you to move (Move)
One nation under a groove
House music always soothes
So get with the flow, let's go, yo
Can you rock to a house groove tempo?
If so, then shall we let the games begin?
What better-off position can you be in?
I'm on fire, the flame's too hot to douse
The pool is over, come into my house
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
(Give me body)
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
(Give me body)
Here's a dance step from Al and Kika
Bass and treble flow through the speakers
Ride the rhythm, I know it's gonna reach you
I'm the Queen Latifah
Now it's time to run through it
45 King? (Yeah, baby?), cue it
Yeah, there you go, I told you you could do it
Now did you enjoy it? (That was cool), I knew it
Dance to the beat of the drum, give me some
With the Flavor Unit, I've come
To say ride the groove line, don't swing the pipe bomb
Listen to the smooth line, throw away the white line
It's a house party I'm hostin' (What?)
Come and rock with the one who's chosen
It can't turn me inside out (Uh-uh)
For those who dare to, come into my house
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
(Give me body)
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
(Give me body)
It's a new fusion I'm usin'
You ask what is it I'm doin'? (What?)
Hip-hop house, hip-hop jazz with a little pizzazz
From the Queen (The Queen), the Queen of royal badness
Remember me from ""Wrath of My Madness""?
It's my rap (My rap), that rocks this party
I'ma hijack (Hijack), and jack your body
This is not an erotic interlude
Keep in mind I move multitudes
The Asiatic Black woman, hardcore beat drummin'
It's hard to keep a good woman down, so I keep comin'
Blow for blow, I take and I get some
Still I rise in a civilized wisdom
I hope the lyrical display has you around
It's an open invitation, come into my house
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
(Give me body)
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
(I want you to give me body)
Don't make me wait

Before you even try to diss me
Let's get something clear
There ain't no fear between you and me or the atmosphere
Hail to the queen and the sire
I'm lighting fires
Your style is wack as two flat tires
It will only take a second
For me to just wreck it
Smoother than my body buck naked

Driving so fast that no one could catch me
While I'm knocking ""Gangsta Bitch"" by Apache
This is the mood for making the hit hip-hop song
You should have known it was on
The places I've been, the people I've seen
And everywhere I go, it's “Give it to 'em, Queen!”
'Cause hip-hop is for real, I'm dealing with the truth
'Cause all over the world, it's aggravated youth
So every time I grab the mic, you know that I could rock it
So I can have some fun and put some money in my pocket
You can always know the time, just recognize the sign
Can't nobody put a padlock on your mind

I'm me till I'm old and grey
And when that day comes
Imma teach my daughters to be the same way
I am the way I am, I'm from the hood

The first floor's a bore, so I’ll rise
Don't want to make it to the top too quickly
So I take step-to-step all the time
Take a look at the flow of the future
If you can't shake to it, then it don’t suit ya
Break off, back off, before I bust off
Bad is the worst, some are bad but soft
Bad this, bad that, who's bad enough?
For those who are bad, then batter up
I pointed this rap with my index
So baby, come on with a rag and some Windex
I'm stepping the step tryna meet me there
I'm avoiding all political fanfare
If you down take a pounding from ya fist-a
For the sound of the nature of a sista'
Who's a king, who's a queen, who's tryna bang?
I see myself as a queen but it ain’t for rank
This for all, not one, not for income
But for knowing who and where we descend from
I kick off with a choke, I come crazy new
They call me Mama Zulu but I won’t baby you
I'm not the type to look for a man with cash
But the only thing you get if you’re broke's a cast
I dip, then switch, what floor is this?
I go higher than a fire, try to diss
This is a little of my headed-for-top style
Rippin tracks, whippin' in fact, it's that wild
Right on flow, a few floors to go
I see suites instead of concrete, so
If you down take a pounding from ya fist-a
For the sound of the nature of a sista’
Here's a knick-knack, sit back, hold ya hat
Here's a big rap, ya got close now get back
I got an army bustin through the enemy's wall
My thoughts on the situation was ""fuck em all""
Salt-N-Pepa said it was time to grow
So me and Spin did 'em in, now time to go
Yo-Yo grabbed him, he said, ""Hey, diddle diddle""
While I and Nikki got Monie out of the middle
Sisters in action, strong, real, still complete
I say ""what up"" cause you can't come or compete
The La, the Ti-Fah booms like a speaker
I hold more soul than a sneaker
Don't ask if I'm fast, I come swift, sis
Cause I'm passing an ass if you with this

You ain't got no work for me (no work, no work)
Or any Flavor Unit MC (no work, no work)
You ain't got no work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got no work for the queen (no work, no work)
Don't try to get fly, y'all
We're blackin' up eyeballs
I run with a rough set, so don't get me upset
I gas you so hard, I leave you fartin'
You're soft as a buttercup, stupid ass, so why you startin'?
You're memorizing every damn lyric that I write
You're all up in my mouth every time I grab the mic
You need to learn a lesson from a female headbanger
Stop ridin' on my bra, you freakin' straphanger
Until we play Techs, but I always stay free
I made a resolution for you, 1993
It's all about the Flavor Unit and my family
'Cause I would die for all them and they would die for me
Leary about this intelligent female, all catch hell
An explanation of the Queen Latifah spelled well
So blow up and know me
Don't even contemplate a theory about jerkin' me
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for the queen (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
Nor any Flavor Unit MCs (no work, no work)

Play me like a child, but you know I'm grown
See waterworks, so take your broke ass home
That was the way it started out back in the day
A little singin' joint with the hardcore phrase
Amazed I wouldn't diss another sister 'less she had it coming
And even then, I would take it to her face
My presence is stunning, cunning as a venus fly trap
'Cause, word up, I fight back, you're damn right, it's like that
So step back, I'm not the type of girl
You can run through and drop
I'm not the type of girl to be running to the cops
I know about everything that goes on on my block
And right beside my bed, I keep a Luger and a Glock
They're for the protection of a Flavor Unit queen
Me not gon' let ya go until me hear ya scream
I look in your eyes when I speak to your punk ass
I ought to put my feet to you
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for the queen (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
Nor any Flavor Unit MCs (no work, no work)
Now, this wicked curse hurts
Spank your girls and boys, I'm annoyed
You gots no work, so I lurk to keep you unemployed
I'm a part of a tribe with a vibe
I scribe with nine lives, you're kicked inside outside
I used to ride the path across the tracks in your mouth
Until I jumped the turnstile and the conductor threw me out
You feelin' kinda horny? Call a clinic on that crotch
You's a dingy, dirty bitch, so I gotta Shout it out
I had it up to here, plus there
'Cause I'll be here plus there
We'll bump heads
There's nuff lumps everywhere
Nigga-niggas say the hood ain't changed
I get my niggies with the hoodies
Far from goody, but they're bad instead
We're ready for the worst things first
Anything you thought, I thought twice, thought through, and thought first
The queen picks the verse off a shirt
You hurt when I smirk 'cause you know first
You ain't got work for the queen (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for the queen (no work, no work)

Forgive the crowds, oh, Lord, they know not why they sweat me
Biting's against the law in the place that I live
So I lock up the door with the keys to my crib
They call me the high priestess of disaster
Although I'm not a dread and not a Rasta
There's never been a word I can't master
I've always been a piddly pastor
I reign, the lesson of today

To show the skeezers the meaning of humility, huh

I'm snatchin' hearts 'cause I'm Latifah and I want to

Action, come now
Rappers should unite under one crown
And realize that we all under one fam
Go back, go back, go back, go back (Easy, easy, easy, easy)
Easy, maestro
This one is for the competitors, sing
I stepped into a basement party in Brooklyn
The brothers was lookin' as soon as I put a foot in
A female walked up to me and said, ""Latifah, bust a line
I don't think you're on the strength, show me the time""
I said, ""If you really want to do this, we can do this, fine
Take six paces and begin to rhyme""
As soon as she attempted to make a sound
I ate her up with the verb, broke her down with the noun
'Cause I hate when someone challenges me but cannot balance with me
I get annoyed when they can't go blow for blow
I get pissed when I hear the lyrics a sucker brings
Haha, I was thinkin' the same thing
Well, I was approached by a whole damn group of 'em
Rhyme fiends, biters, and bums
Took me kinda light, said they wanted to fight
I kinda got uptight, you didn't do what I think you did? Yeah, right
Bash went the first, smash went the next one
What about the third? He started, he started to run
But to his surprise, his feet must have slipped
'Cause I snapped that neck before the second step (Oh, snap)
You see you may speculate, but everybody knows
Not one amateur can deal with the pros

If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say, ""Bah, bah""
There was a time that a man could go
Anyplace, anywhere without a Rambo
But now me have to keep me pistol loaded with rhyme
Have to deal with bad-breath biters that step out of line
So when they make a move, them haffi surely get a taste of it
I'm Daddy-O and I don't quit

Of my rhyme, because I'm writin' stiff rhymes in stacks
And four words for the wack, just stay the hell back
'Cause it's a fact if you're wack, you ain't sayin' jack
So we can go rhyme for rhyme if you wish
But eatin' you suckers is my favorite dish
And I warned you suckers if you messed with me
You'll be the next ingredient in my recipe
Start and don't finish, I'll hunt you down

That's what I'm thinking of
That's what I want from you
To thine own self be true
Black on black love
That's what I'm thinking of
C'mon, 'cause we're in this together, y'all
Let's try to make our hoods a little better, y'all
Last night after I prayed, I layed my head down
Tired after a hard day
I blocked out the siren sound
As I fell into a deep sleep
I don't have dreams of cream
My dreams are vivid and seldom seen
And much to my delight
I saw my peoples in a different light
Tension was gone
We stood Black and strong
Instead of a day
We had a lifetime of atonement
I felt loved
I didn't have to treasure the moment
Instead of drugs, we gave out hugs
And you payed with pain
No more thugs and
Everybody knew everybody's name
No tricks, no cheaters, women beaters, pimps or whores
Less stress, and a whole lot less liquor stores
Children played without worries of strays
Longer days with shorter nights
No need to fight
We all stuck tight
We stayed away from the traps
As a people, we lived right and exact
And showed a whole lot more of that
In my dream, we all loved our neighbors
Did each other favors
And used the good sense God gave us
Watched each others' backs
And lifted while we climb
There was no crime
None of my brothers was doin' time
And they treated all their sisters like ladies
Women didn't worry because their men didn't act shady
Mothers were proud of their seeds
And kept a big smile
'Cause the whole village chipped in
And raise that one child
We supported our local Black-owned stores
We were down for the cause
The next man make sure you had yours
There were no robberies, murders, or rapes
No child molesters
We took control of our own fate
The life span of the Black man increased
Times were less stressed
We did our best to live in peace
We showed love for rap
Kept in contact
We stayed away from the traps
And showed a whole lot more of that
Now as I wake up to face this harsh mentality
It's just a dream or prayer, far from reality
As I wait, the siren sounds begin again
I get up, walk to my window
Wondering if it will ever end
When I look out, nothing's changed
Hustlers are still there
Lady on the phone yelling how her baby father doesn't care
Conflicts with derelicts over squeegies
Homeless will work for food
""Would you please feed me?""
It's our duty to try and help remove some of the stress
Every 20 minutes a child dies a violent death
Parents are frustrated
Wondering where they went wrong
Knowing that that fast money, it won't last long
We got some that fight for rights to be equal
Some struggle, and still we commit crimes against our own people

The Queen Latifah, the King of 45
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor
I make beats, she rock rhymes, so I gave her
A sample sound, then she added a compound
Word, this is for those who haven't heard
A King and Queen combine minds and trample
Those who oppose us, here's example
It's time to run your thought, the King and Queen is on the set
The competition's petty and ready to step
To the first one, go 'head, rehearse one
I hope you don't know you sound like the worst one
Rhymes are smokin', concentration can't be broken
Queen Latifah's outspoken
Use your imagination, picture this
Any male or female rapper tryin' to diss
Here for excitement and enticement
With my competitors killed, I go build with my enlightenment
Teach the youth, feed the needy
Confident, a descendent of Queen Nefertiti
The mother of civilization will rise
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation
Secondary, but necessary to reproduce
Acknowledge the fact that I'm Black and I don't lack
Queen Latifah is givin' you a piece of my mind
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher
Rhymes I do employ, no time for slimy toys
I'm steady and stable and my label is Tommy Boy
Backed by The Unit, produced by The King
Confession pressed with the style that we bring
For the hip-hop patients, this is a King and Queen creation
Technician, musical musician
I'm statin' facts, strictly nonfiction
In hip-hop, you wonder who's the trouble most
Creativity, you get a double dose
How can you stop me? No, I put you to a test
The rhymes are Romeo (The beat's a Juliet)
We'll try to blend, this makes me a hard one
Persevere, I'm here, gets taught one
Strength producer, I send you an ultimatum
Hardcore worldwide is how I take 'em
I rock, never hyperventilate
Others get tired, could use a commercial break
45 King, DJ Mark's my alias
It takes a ton of MCs to prevail against me
Just listen, I'm unstoppable
You want a mission?  This one's impossible
Beats rock all night with no curfew
My talent's advanced, you haven't a clue
How I do it, the smoothest, loopest, spare it
If the style fits, I wear it
Many attempts was made, none was recognized
45 King set sound personified
I'm goin' to Wonderland and check, find out who's next
You pretty good, but not quite a legend yet
Studio mixer, I got the formula
It's every man for himself, I'm warnin' you
It's my domain, just ask my chauffeur
My ride's equipped, everything from a pool to a sofa
On top, it's a usual act

It's just a flow, it's just a flow
It's just a flow, it's just a flow
It's just a flow, it's just a flow
It's just a flow, it's just a flow
I give a shout out
To every earthling on the planet
Especially Jersey
And New York
Chilled in Irvington
Born in Newark
Thanks for support
It's just a flow
I'd like to say hello (hello)
Even though I know
You don't know me
It's just a stack 
Kick from the pack 
Gimme a smile
C'mon, you can show me
Take an inspiration from the S.I.D
Thanks for the beat
It's kinda fly
And oh yeah, Sa'Buddah told me tell ya hi
She thinks you're sweet
I'm looking for the vibe y'all
Then I must be looking for my tribe y'all
I'm rolling with the F-L-A-V-O-R and Unit
Somebody in the house, gimme five, y'all
And get live, y'all
And just clap your hands to the beat
'Cause I gotta go find out where we got the loot
'Cause I gotta know
I put special concentration on the flow
I love to see you and me say, “ho!”
It's just a flow, it's just a flow
It's just a flow, it's just a flow
It's just a flow, it's just a flow
It's just a flow, it's just a flow
Wheel out
Sexy baby doll, girl that's me yo, QL
I get loose, y'all, I get loose, y'all
I get loose, l-loose, l-loose, loose, y'all
I get loose, y'all
You don't know nothing
Gotta get loose, y'all

34888,Queen Latifah,Parlay,"Parlay Lyrics
Parlay? Hardly. Get money all day
Slip? You fall prey, go out the hard way
Receive a caution, fuck the flossing
Slip and be costing
Strictly big bossing to get the fortune
Parlay? Hardly. Get money all day
Slip? You fall prey, go out the hard way
Receive a caution, fuck the flossing
Slip and be costing
Strictly big bossing to get the fortune
You not ready to test the La
Faking the funk
Confess or die
Not physically, but lyrically
Come on, give it your best try
The flow's coming
Don't get caught up in it
Talking about straps and gats
When the only tools you had had water in it
Wait a minute, I'm about to spark shit
If you smoking 20 blunts a day
Chances are you smoking garbage
A whore bitch? No me, no never
Too clever, too feminine
I'm on the winnin-in
Selector rewind and come again
Then let it drop again, don't stop again
Rappers is petty
Latifah coming for her props again
No matter where in the US you reside
Lyrically I commit justifiable homicide
I represent the felines
The kind that used to like to tree climb
And been respected since I start to speak mine
Parlay? Hardly. Get money all day
Sleep? You fall prey
Go out the hard way
Beyond lights and cameras
Behind the glamours
Ghetto scramblers with broken rammers
Cock the hammers
Fuck the flash and stashin' Benjamin grands and Jacksons
Money's the passion
Greeds the lust for satisfaction
Cash flow like Castro
Fast dough don't last though
Would you'd have let the mass know?
Feds don't let that ass go
 on your trail since uncover surveillance
Ya man in jail tense
He's one of two assailants
Peeps the lesson
Use the 'xpression
Times are stressing
No depression, minds advanced like The Jetsons
No dirt where you be at
Think before you react
It's the famous  that's
Quick to bring the heat back
Made moves wrong? Fortune's gone, you're singing sad songs
Still reminiscing about the days you was on
Parlay? Hardly. Get money all day
Slip? You fall prey
Go out the hard way
La Fem Markita & Latifah
Givin' you what you need
What it be about?
Heineken to the head
Yin to the yang
We vacation in places where the nation's language is French
Ride the whip to Merrill Lynch
While others ride the bench
We come through in the clench
You never see us flinch
Your cheese come in increments
Mine come 'til I'm drenched
Slim bars from the femme squad
Chick meaner than M-Ra
Wanna spar? We can go par
5'2"", leave your chin scarred
No complication
Mine and conquer nations
Deep concentration
Realize the comp you're facing
Ay yo, hand over this
Gettin' money hand over fist
No time to parlay
Hunting them hundreds that's crisp
Producers that's A-list
Lyrics that lace this to
Make sure these hits never miss
When we play this
Fem Markita, Queen Latifah, the double feature
A track done by each for thoughts to reach ya
Parlay? Hardly. Get money all day
Slip? You fall prey
Go out the hard way

Shades
Mr. Big Stuff
Who do you think you are
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna get my love
You’re begging me to go easy when I hitcha
But I never do, like a crane I come and splitcha
Break your bank in 2, y'all get the picture
Marvel at the power I gain, still counting the days
Articles written about the ways
That I scammed him, got him, beat him, hooked him
And less is still made about how this little girl shook him
I took him for everything they had, the kitchen sink
I got him making appointments to the town shrink
Don't question my status, executive it’s evident
I'm the one holding the bag counting dead presidents
All the evidence is leading back to nowhere, I swear
Detecting me's a waste
Free be gone without a trace, no case
That's how I leave 'em, stressing, guessing
Renigging ain't no use, fessing all the truth
So the next time that you're dogging my fame
Just remember I'm the one who signs the checks in your name
Mr. Big Stuff
Who do you think you are
Mr. Big Stuff (tell me)
You’re never gonna get my love
Mr. Big Stuff
You’re gonna break my heart
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna make me cry
Making a killing off my dealings
Now they catching feelings
Start blowing up the spot, now here come the glass ceiling
I ain’t new but I gotta dishes
And telling the ability to bring it to fruition, that's why you dissing
You frontin' like my ideas is yours or so score
They got laws against that, I done seen them scrap the poor
'Cause the penny you saved was the penny you earned
And bronze done been burned
I ain’t Tina but it's my turn
I'll be the man after the WO
That holds the flow in the position of the CEO
And know your banks is getting taken like C-Lo
You know I gots to get the dough so spare me the ego
Before I D Bo
You a brown noser, I know ya
Peep the game of Queen maintain the composure
Now I'm breaking down the whole boy network
The sucky shirts get nerts when I assert
Mr. Big Stuff
Who do you think you are
Mr. Big Stuff (tell me)
You're never gonna get my love
Mr. Big Stuff (Mr. Big Stuff, baby)
You're gonna break my heart
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna make me cry
You too busy looking at the frame to see what the picture hold
When they made me, nigga, they broke the mold
Not your average itty little bitty acting silly
I got too much at stake to let you think you really come to your senses
The consequences ain't now joke
I knew what was on your mind before you even spoke
Dirty, you acting flirty and I wonder why
You never look me in my face always focused on my thighs
But you'll see, 'cause while you're playing dumb
While I'm scheming on your office in your chairs
First class up in the air
They say a woman needs love, but me, I beg to differ
Live as bills, excite me, I could do without the slippers
Some say the macho, I'm on line to road to riches
Evil don't scare me, I got the better snitches
So check the situation, ain't no penetration
Free and Queen La, obscene, no duplication

You're never gonna get my love

Why is you wanna make me cry?

Your love is like a chunk of gold
Hard to gain, hard to hold
Like a rose that's soft to touch
Love has gone and it hurts so much
Well then why...
Must the same love that made me laugh, make me cry?
Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain
Think about it being a great big rock
Won't you think before you started to roll it down
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop
I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me, baby
I don't want to live
Well then why...
Oh, why
Must the same love that made me laugh, gon make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry? 
Why you wanna make me lay in my pillow
I'm just cryin' like a weeping willow
Tell me why, oh, why, oh, why
Why you wanna go home and make your lady cry

And now you act so wrong and mean to me

Pretty baby, you are the soul who snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me, crazy music
Music that keeps calling me so very close to you
Turns me your slave
Come and do with me any little thing you want to
Anything baby, just let me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies
How I worry about you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love?
So tell me why stop to think
About this weather, my dear?
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again, oh baby
Won't you come and put our two hearts together?
That would make me strong and brave
Oh when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let it rain
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane

Won't you please let me love you

But social circles spin too fast for me

I like the theater but never come late
I never bother with people I hate

Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls

I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell and read every line

Find out more by going to Mclyte.com!
Get it if you can, if you cannot get up off the pot
You been missing, pissing up the spot a lot
And I've been waiting on the sideline, give you the guideline
Get up in that pocket like a pocket light, but they don't rock it right
They don't concern me, can't even burn me
Not even with a lighter, all them liars, they ain't worthy
You heard me, I'm a loner: me, myself, and I
I'm a powerhouse, ready to collide with the greatest tide
It's like a typhoon in the making
What I'm saying leave your whole city shaking, broken down, better start praying
I ain't playing, this ain't hopscotch, on the block, or skelly up in den streets
Get jelly whenever we meet
Chic, I'm about my paper; dudes, see ya later
South side of the equator, so hot, gotta thank my maker
I'm here, flow with the best of them, get low with the rest of them
Rang the alarm in '88 and I'm still buzzin'
Cousin, they trying to hate, but I just elevate
Get it straight: I'm Lyte as a rock and they featherweight

I'm trying to give you the code, let the future unfold
I had to follow them rules, that's how I open them doors
I put that work in; check
Hustle hard; check
I paid my dues; yep
I gave you hits like Ruffneck
And I'm still grinding; yep
Still shining; yep
I'm all that's left; yep
I'm still the best, but you ain't yet
I'm living life to the fullest, everywhere I go they ask
How you pass like a bullet, speed of Lyte and that Lytro gas
Here I go, there I go, here I go again
I ain't no fad like Michael Jack, they know I'm Bad
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
You from the hood, you understood, and understand just who I am
I live to be free, I live for the beat, I live for the biz
That's what it is, no wondering, I get it in, I get it done
You are the one, but I am the Lyte; without me, you're out of sight
I'm taking this entire game to a new height
Just watch me, just like you do YouTube and Hulu
Lyte is back and all over this map like who knew
Rapping to you; listen because I might not say it again
Find good people, wave them in
Let them haters and them hoes go, there ain't no saving them
It's casualties in this game of life, that may not seem right
So if you get it, then get it get it, then get it right
You said you seen it all, but you ain't never seen the Lyte

35058,Roxanne Shanté,Deadly Rhymes,"Juice Crew members Kool G. Rap and Roxanne Shante trade four-bar battle rhymes.
Deadly rhymes the pages of rage strikes again
Killing men, women and children
Til defeat, types of shelter, helter skelter
Nobody's around here to help ya
Up in flames, the brainstorm rain drains your veins
The only remains is rains of brains
Fixed to mix, Shante's lyrics cause conflicts
I'm bookin' my rhymes like convicts
God prayed for a death wish? Come on, step up
Some tried to keep up, but never kept up
When I roll, nobody can't hold me
So they all told me to make 'em die slowly
The warning signs of danger read ""please take precautions""
I'm giving your baby rhymes abortions
Hit the deck when I wreck, one got shot in the neck
Poison escaped through the tape decks
Confusion, havin' a need for a blood transfusion
She couldn't stop my intrusion
You're in the path of a lyrical tidal wave
Sound waves take you straight to your graves
Pain remains in your head, suffocation
Strangulation, wipe out a whole nation
On stage tryin' to recite like me
But what I really see is Creepshow 3
I size em up to die and pulverize 'em
So bad, her own mother won't recognize her
This goes for those, that oppose like foes
But I don't diss (I dispose)
Somewhere right near nightmare right where you might hear
Songs are long like light years
So here's a taste of the lyrical greats of all time
WHAT? Deadly rhymes
*Chorus*
Attack, ready to track the wack rappers who slack
I attract, cause you lack, you sad sack
The microphone fanatic comin' in with the impact
In fact this track, to subtract, I pack
A pile of stacks back in the sack for snacks
But I react, right and exact, cause I'm black
Got a taste, and treble and bass you can't chase
In case you wanna race the pace I got haste
To ace in your case, in your face just like mace
I replace, wreck the place and then erase, sho'!
I captivated, those that violated
Alienated, styles annihilated
Rappers, evacuated, faded, vacated
Waited, for my spot to be isolated
Crash and smash and bash you in the trash
In a flash, I whiplash you burned to an ash
A mass defeat, delete, rhymes are like concrete
Rap athletes all retreat to my beat
Except they don't step with pep, they get carried in a stretcher
Done by the treacherous rap wrecker
Start tearin' and scarin', what you're hearin'
Will put fear in, so I'm comparin'
You get tossed across like Kris Kross
To force, you fell of course, boss (so now you're lost)
All rhymes are organized like crime
That's why I titled this here design

But I know you very well
So let me tell about Da Brat-ta-ta-ta-ta
I'm light skin, redbone, peanut butter complxion
Very affectionate, very direct
When I'm expressing myself
I'm 5'5"", my astrology sign is Aries
Thick in my thighs, 36Bs
Pretty brown eyes, no hair weaves
Put it down with these lucious suckable lips
Making you wanna reach out and touch'em
Come on and give me a kiss
Could it be those hips just pokin' out of my jeans?
I showed them once or twice
And some niggas have become feems
I'm a javouci rocking, hat cockin, blunt smoking
No stopping, weave cocking
With constant heat dropping
Bombs on nonbelievers charming
All the people, they fallin' like Alicia
I'm preaching what I'm speaking
This you ain't used to seeing
So please, believe it, you needin the B to the R muthafucking AT
I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you and I can't let it go
I'm steppin in the club now ya'll, hey now
Niggas showing me love ya'll, hey now
I rapp for my thugs ya'll, hey now
Especially my niggas, they got the ooh
I'd be sitting in my car waiting on you to drop off my package
A big zipped locked baggy to support my habit
We'll go together like Roger and Jessica Rabbit
I'm spoiled rotten, I'm rocking pink silk panties at the moment
But I'm sport cotton but jeanie's dreamin' of
Jeanie will blink me to scottie
So he can beam me pump adrenaline into my blook steam
Proceed extremely with caution
I'm probably gleaming
Because my bling bling is worth a fortune
It seems things will never change
So I puffed often cause these days niggas is crazy
You can't pay me to roll without my AK
I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you and I can't let it go
(Check it out)
I can't let go of this game
I can't let go of this fame
But for sure, before I go
You niggas gonna know my name
'Cause I'm so doogie, one in a million
Cop a brazzillion for the coochie that rides smoothly
Pass the doogie, the dutchie
Rudely interrupted, your regularly scheduled program
I throw down and bust it
There ain't no hoe around touching me
I'm sharper than cutlerly
I slice niggas to itty bitty pieces
I'm steppin in the club now ya'll, hey now
Niggas showing me love ya'll, hey now
I rapp for my thugs ya'll, hey now
Especially my niggas, they got the ooh
I guess you wonder where I've been

I came back to let you know

And that's the story, no life no more, just the loss
Caught up in between the negative and positive force
Carmen Brown, sad tale of a life cut short
Who will take the responsibility when the guns go off?
On one side you have Hill, he got to live with the guilt
Is he the one that she needed or the one that got a kill?
Or is it Carmen to blame for her own downfall?
Did she play with his heart and never loved him at all?
It doesn't matter now because she is resting in peace
And all the playas in the game have to live with the grief
It's only now that she's gone, you will truly discover

So, so, so funkdafied
Now what you hear is not a test
It's the B-to the-R-A-T and the best
I'm hittin' switches like Erick on the solo creep
For your Jeep it's the B-R-A-T
Puttin' a dip in your hip from right to left

Well, yo, that's my clique
Ay homie, that's who I rolls with
And we kicks nothing but the fattest sh...
Them calls me the funkdafied, funkalistic, vocalistic
That they ain't ready fo' but they just don't hear me though
(Why?) Because we're so funkdafied
(Why?) We make you move from side to side
Well, comin' straight from the 6-0-6-4-4
It's Da Brat and J.D. (Tadow), big baby (Ha ha)
So lay back and listen as I catch up on my pimpin'
And freak this duet just like Ashford and Simpson

Puttin' it down, puttin' it down ain't a thang to me
And ain't too many hoes that can hang with me
It's like that and as a matter of fact
When it comes the Brat-tat-tat-tat
I'll make your neck snap back
Meaning I got the hit that'll get'cha bent
Tearin' the roof off this mutha like Parliament
I'm on a roll In Control like Janet, dammit
Brat, you're the funk bandit and they can't handle it
I know, that's why I keep hittin' 'em with this grammar
Lettin' all y'all know that I'm the real mamma jamma
Straight to the head like a chronic sack
I pass the mic to the Brat
And yo I passed it back
Well-a, sistas and fellas
It's time to get your groove on
I provide the funkdafied sounds that make you move, holmes
Breaking these fools off proper like
It's S.O. S.O. D.E.F. dynamite, right
Humunah, humunah, comin' up at cha like Ralph K
And since this ain't no Honeymoon, I'm here to stay
And the way we're comin' at cha, baby, we can't miss

Sexy ladies, goin crazy, cause the beat's like whoa whoa whoa
Fresh out the federal building
To Bentley Coupes with the convertible ceilings
It's the black widow, call me Miss White
I done been through it all, shootouts and fistfights
Brooklyn bitch, you go wrong I get right
Back with a classic, now gimme six mics
Can't reach me on the phone, then send a bitch a kite
Man I do's it in heels or a pair of crisp Nikes
Stand behind Martin Luther King, but I'm more like Malcolm X
Guerillas beatin on they chest, get it right on Malcolm X
Just keep the peace, cause if cowards show me disrespect
My niggas put his soul to rest and I don't wanna see you stressed
Champagne at my campaign, Kim for mayor
Told you I'm the same bitch from the escalator
And I ain't trippin off you rats and investigators
Get your envelopes, time to address the haters

The feds tryin to shut us down like Nino
We keep it goin man, we keep it goin man
Won't stop, can't gotta keep it goin man
See I do it for the fans, they'll never understand
While they goin off course, me I'm stickin to the plan

In the jail jumpsuit, still a bad bitch though

Then I showed the hood the world ain't just made for rich folk

Like back in the days way before the record deal
Hustlin, tryin to get a meal steady tryin to flip a brick
Ya girl had the blues you would thought I was fuckin crip
I sip that crystal shit and smoke a L and at the same time
Try to strategize how to get this paper
More money, more haters
Especially when you ain't the average bitch
Cause I'm a boss (yo that's deep)
Cause I be on some ""get it how you get it""
You know, ""money over niggas""-type thing
I got these rap dames turnin green like they want it with the queen Ms G.O.A.T, never stressin, tell these bitches better fight for second
Even though it gets lonely at the top
Anything is better than being back on the block
Cause don't nobody know it's Kimberly Jones then the Queen B
Know what I mean?
Every now and then I start trippin and get to thinkin bout BK thugs in the pj's or my peoples (yeah I know what you mean)
That's living illegal
Don't let niggas mislead you, the streets is evil
Ain't nobody in the game stuntin like we do
I'ma make it to a bill, trust this
Just give me some time like the judge did
If you hatin, y'all can get the middle finger, fuck it is Nathan
Kiss em, thats my pussy you tastin
Amazing, Queen B in the place
My thoughts paint pictures y'all just copy and trace
Don't fuck with the fake or talk about em (uhn huh)
Fuck the law always kept it hardcore like my first album
(so why don't you just soften up) never that
The first code on the street is to never rat

Can you feel it?
'Cause I can
Oh
Oh
Oh
I been on my grind for a while now
Time to attack now
Lean in the low in the background
Can't stop my hustle, it's for life
Gotta get that money
I won't let no one put me in a box
I'm gon' fight my way to top
Things ain't goin' right
You need a Lil' Kim in your life
I'm that light when you can't see
That air when you can't breathe
I'm that 
I'm that voice when you can't speak
I'm your, your respirator
I'm that high when you feel low
I'm that strength when you feel weak
I'm that truth when you don't believe
I'm that blood that your heart beats
I'm your, your respirator
If you feel me, go ""oh, oh-la-hee-oh, oh""
If you hear me, go ""oh, om-na-ha-lo-eh""
People sweated on Lil' Kim
But I'm not what they think I am
Instead of hatin' on what you see
Come get to know me
I'm done with playin' by the same ol' rules
Ya girl over here makin' major moves
Sick and tired of the same ol' dudes
I smell new money
I know I like to dance sleezy
No, but that don't mean that I'm easy
First he gotta know how to please me
And I'll be there if he needs me
But I won't let no man put me in a box
I'm gon' fight my way to the top
Things ain't goin' right
He need a Lil' Kim in his life
I'm that light when you can't see
That air when you can't breathe
I'm that 
I'm that voice when you can't speak
I'm your, your respirator
I'm that high when you feel low
I'm that strength when you feel weak
I'm that truth when you don't believe

If you hear me, go ""oh, om-na-ha-lo-eh""
To all my people across the world
Need the life support? Then I'm ya girl
Tt's a jungle in these streets
Don't let them get you
'Cause I been through the same ol' things
I know it's hard to get out the game
Dealin' with the hurt and pain
I'm ridin' with you
I know every day is a struggle
Tryna get by, don't want the trouble
But if you touch a piece of my puzzle
You gon' get a piece of my muscle
'Cause I don't let no one put me in a box
I'm gon' fight my way to the top

35466,Lil' Kim,Rockin’ (My World Demo),"Yeah, uh
You put your wrist in
I put my wrist in, what's missing?
I'm talking to you, cuz when I shine, I glisten
Sure picked a fine time not to listen
Now you fucked up, without a pot to piss in
Is it me, or is the rap game different?
Niggas makin' indirect calls, long distance
Thinkin I'm gon' stop, I'm too persistent (uh huh)
And I won't drown, I'm water-resistant
Mmmm, Think about when you say my name
This female rapper got a knuckle game
I leave you all out of commission
Me fall off? Under one condition
They gotta find my body dumped in the sewer
Black and blue-r, underneath horse manur-er
C. Delores T., screw her, I never knew her
I'm good, like milk mixed with Kahlúa
Intimidated by the songs I made
You soft like suede, I'm sharp as a blade
This ain't a phase, it's the way I was raised
And I'm still gon' blaze when I'm old and grey, c'mon
Rockin, rockin, we keep it
Rockin, rockin, we just don't
Stop it, stop it, til this real hot, hot
Rockin, rockin, we keep it
Rockin, rockin, we just don't
Stop it, stop it, til this real hot, hot
(Yeah yeah) It's QB y'all, sweet and petit
About five feet with the oversized heat, what
I've got the right shoes, you've got two left feet (Uh huh)
One's incomplete, tryna make ends meet (Come on)
Before the album drop, you want a sneak peak
You're on the wrong block, this a one-way street (That's right)
Hundred grand petty cash in the hotel suite
Move your feet, lose your seat, shall I repeat (Yeah yeah)
When the LaLa hits my eyes, red as a beet
Niggas hungry? I got something to eat
Open your mouth, swallow the skeet
Mmm Ahh.. Bon Appetit
Can you keep an erection? (What)
Cuz Kim got love and affection (Who)
Let me shoot it off in your direction (Come on)
Only if you pass the inspection, the bassline
Meet me in the mezzanine
Matter of fact, hop up in my limousine
You can trick or treat, like it's Halloween
In my Lamborghini with the green, high beams, squeaky clean
The way I gargle like it's Listerine (Uh huh)
Just be messing up my Maybelline
So stick it in me like a vaccine (Ohhh)
Then I can come clean, like hygiene, in a pocket full of dreams
Rockin, rockin, we keep it
Rockin, rockin, we just don't
Stop it, stop it, til this real hot, hot
Rockin, rockin, we keep it
Rockin, rockin, we just don't
Stop it, stop it, til this real hot, hot
(Yeah yeah) Now to the haters, the fake-ass Dons and Donettes
I smack you hoes in the face with two techs (Hey)
You can be a redhead, blonde or brunette (Uh)
I ain't tryin to catch rec, I just want respect
What the heck, I go to the bank with two cheques
Yours and mine, when it's time to pay debts
Finally, I can put all this mess to rest
And I'm glad I got this bullshit off my chest
And we can still go toe to toe, blow for blow (Come on come on)
Take it to the screen, like Joe Piscopo (That's right)
Go to award shows, lock down the first rows
Our ice keep us froze like Eskimos
We rock coliseums, submarines (Put your hands in the air)
Infrared beams with the tank machines
So hate all you want, radio gon' knock it
We locked in a pocket, and I'mma keep rockin
Rockin, rockin, we keep it
Rockin, rockin, we just don't
Stop it, stop it, til this real hot, hot
Rockin, rockin, we keep it
Rockin, rockin, we just don't
Stop it, stop it, til this real hot, hot
(Yeah, yeah)
Uh, uh huh, yeah, rockin' rockin'
Rockin' rockin'
Rockin' come on
Rockin' rockin'
We keep it
Yeah, we don't stop
C'mon

Long-nose double barreled rifle, check
Semi-automatic infrared laser beam shot, check
Alright Puff, I'm ready to go
Threw the clips around the shoulders
Toasters in the holster]
(Kim, let's go!) Slow down bab' bro
You with the rap Rambo, Tony Montana
Here's a hammer, a camera, and a ""Life After Death"" bandana
Here take it, in case I don't make it
'Cause if my life don't end, I'm damn sure gon' fake it
The way I see it, mmm, sexual
In the gunfight, two on three, you on me
Dawg, I got shit to make the world shake
One mistake, blaow, start a earthquake
Fuck them niggas, them niggas dust to me
And if I knock Cyrus off, that's a plus for me
And the funny thing about it, I'm a bitch
And got niggas runnin' from me like the Olympics
And I'm told my man Gutter, I'ma get him
And every shell I spit is guaranteed to hit him (blaka!)
Don't you know, I'm talking 'bout a Revolution
And it sounds like a whisper
Don't you know, you brought yourself a Revolution
And it sounds like a whisper

I heard Puff callin' like the Holy Tabernacle (Girl)
I'll be down in a minute, I'm drinkin' a Snapple
A Snapple? Bitch, I got bombs and shit
Grenades and razor blades and alarms and shit
You better come on, girl, throw a hat on that weave
I'm tryin' to catch this nigga Cyrus 'fore him and his niggas leave
They at this restaurant that serve African food
Where you allowed to smoke weed and the waiters is type rude
You see, I used to date this bitch from Botswana
Half-African, but she looked like Madonna
And yo, check it, she had a tiger for a pet
I'll never forget, the restaurant is where we met
And her girlfriend Lizette, that bitch is a freak
I used to fuck her in the ass while my girl was asleep
And she the one who told me where these cats is at
I can't wait to get the gat and holla back

Two black and white lesbians (Hey hey, baby)
The nigga Puff ready to holla at these bitches
(Hey baby, let me holla at you for a second)
I'm like, ""Yo dawg, them bitches down with them niggas""
And never would the drugs make the bitch slack up
I got hit men, spreaded through the restaurant for backup
And we communicate through headsets and walkie-talkies
Them niggas just bitches like my Yorkie
Pigs like the Porky, we on point like snipers (Uh huh)
Cyrus and his Doolies is Clueless like the movies (Uh huh)
All I can think about is how he killed my man Smiles
Cut his head off, massacre style
Yeah, Cyrus did it, Cyrus the Virus they call him
When I finish with him please, his name is Swiss Cheese
My main focus is his righthand man Mouse
Sheisty and two-sided, profession dick rider
And his boys, they seem to be all on his dick
I mean the whole situation is really makin' me sick
And when Cyrus got up and dipped off to the bathroom
We started suckin' niggas up like a vacuum (Yeah, take this)
Bullets flyin' nonstop and bodies droppin' (Yeah, motherfuckers)
Puff yelled, ""Away!"" That's the cops then
My trigger finger started itchin'
Then Cyrus came spittin' from the kitchen
And next second you missed it
Listen, it's soundin' like the 4th of July
Like the solar eclipse is lit right in the sky
I can't believe this guy, he won't fall over
Holes is in his body the size of cup holders
One more shot, he's over, shit Puff, I'm empty
(Here, I only got one shot left!)
But I'ma hold my breath 'til he fall to his death
(Die, motherfucker!)
But he was Elvis 'cause little kids squeezed off in his pelvis
Don't you know, I'm talking 'bout a Revolution
And it sounds like a whisper
Don't you know, you brought yourself a Revolution
And it sounds like a whisper
Don't you know, I'm talking 'bout a Revolution
And it sounds like a whisper

Queen with that platinum grammar
I am a diamond cluster hustler, queen chick, supreme chick
Killin' chicks for my bricks by any means chick
Murder scene chick, clean chick, disease-free chick, check it
I write a rhyme, melt in your mouth like M&M's

Pull a trigger for the figure, how you figure?

Bet I wet ya like hurricanes and typhoons

Frank snatch wives, for one point five

Sipping espresso, Cappuccino with Nino
On a mission for the lucci creno
I used to wear Moschino, but every chick got it
Now I rock colorful minks because my pockets stay knotted

You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now you half of me
Get off my dick, kick it bitch!
Check my pitch (Uhh!), authentic persona
And I'll still stick your Moms for her stocks and bonds
I got that bomb diggy spot, a good ol' shot
With hardcore flows to keep a fella hard rock
Sipping Zinfandel, up in Chippendales
Shopping Bloomingdale's for Prada bags
Female Don Dada has no problems splitting cream with my team

808Mula, turn me up
Yeah, it’s YN Drilla
Whole lotta secrets, whole lotta pressure
Let’s go
I don’t chase the fame, I let the stories write they own page
Move like I’m a ghost, they only see me when I switch stage
Talkin' loyalty, I’m silent like a locked cage
If you ain't gang, then your presence in a wrong place
I been countin' blues while they focused on my last text
Never show emotion, just revenge in a black dress
I don’t deal with clowns, let 'em juggle all that fake stress
Standin’ in my power, I ain't worried 'bout who say less
Told my cousin Racks, we gon' eat and then we double plate
Secret routes, secret stash, movin' at a silent rate
Drip too clean, I don’t flex, I just demonstrate
A hundred steps ahead, they still tryna elevate
Keep it quiet, we don't talk, we just slide
Drill secrets in the safe, no one outside
Pressure built, now we shining with no guide
If you know, then you know—real ones don’t lie
Keep it hush, zip it up, that’s the code
Movin' heavy in the field, never fold
Family ties got it stitched in my soul
Lil Kim and Racks, now you know how it go
I was in the basement, dreamin' of a Rolex
Now I’m in the penthouse, plottin’ on the whole next
Cousin said stay focused, they gon' fold with no checks
Never been a puppet, I control my own steps
Cut a couple homies, they was movin' like they wired
Tried to set me up, I just upped and got inspired
City full of snakes, but I’m sharper than the fire
Now I'm cookin' classics while they drownin' in the mire
Told Kim I got her, blood thicker than the chatter
We don’t need no label, every stream gon’ make us fatter
Got a full clip of bars, every word a different dagger
Say they got the smoke? We deliver with no swagger
Keep it quiet, we don't talk, we just slide
Drill secrets in the safe, no one outside
Pressure built, now we shining with no guide
If you know, then you know—real ones don’t lie
Keep it hush, zip it up, that’s the code
Movin' heavy in the field, never fold
Family ties got it stitched in my soul
Lil Kim and Racks, now you know how it go
No captions, no signs, just the truth in the grind
Secrets in the dark, all the diamonds gotta shine
Real don’t need to shout, we just read between the lines

Yeah, Rah Digga, Flipmode, Outsidaz
Shit tight, down to the coochie
Yeah, check it
And I say what's tight
Cause a sister write rhymes all day and all night
Dwelling South of the Hudson, New Jerusalem
In seclusion, using fake pseudonyms
Mind travels like a skitzo on two tabs
With doo rags hangin from my pockets
 Me, the rap bitch that goes back to paediatrics
(Early lessons) rappers like you were straight vixen
So recognize, I make a nigga eyes come alive
Off of five two fives, disguise the camouflage
I shoot a virus out of my spirals with mad priors
For takin' mad niggas titles!
Wetter than a reservoir; lurking in the bushes
Striking blows like Chesimard code-name Hasana
Warmer than a bomber, hotter than the region of Ghana
Get loot like that Trump bitch, Ivana
Now, who be writin rhymes all night
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight
Tight, peace to the ones that don't bite
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight
A black queen, ya best believe my black jeans won't say Paco
I swing to the Vill' for some waffles and some beef falafel
Rap very tight liquor got me different
Dirtier than an overseas shipment of ki's
I write these tight buttas, creme de la guttas
Call me Sheik Digga
Plotting over loops like the eight figures
Baby I'm hard, represent the feminist God
What that gets blunted - watch rhymers runneth, over
See me in the camel Range Rover
Chop, and I won't stop for Jake
And keep heat by the waist for those that playa hate
Now show you the way to blow, better than I tell you
Word to my beeper and my cellular  Polo curls
Digging all the rapper's shit like they go-go girls
Now, who be writin rhymes all night
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight
Tight, peace to the ones that don't bite
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight
Who's the tightest, I rock with laryngitis
Gold's good for Midas, but I want the highest
So don't try me 'cause I beat a bitch, I swear
I'll leave you twisted like a thug with blonde hair, yeah
I blow up the spot like Dennis Scott
Go forward, your chance of defeating me is morbid
'Cause I get you open like the coming of the Pope
When I group shit tighter than a 3 piece suit
Peace, peace, peace to niggas I rhyme wit
My Outsidaz correspondents be more fluid than embalmin'
We pros, I decompose any rapper to the bone
Down to they X and Y chromosome
So see my name tagged in bold or italics
Bow, bitch, cause I'll be the only one salvaged
Number one imported like Beck's
Tighter than three or more heads in a CRX
Now, who be writing rhymes all night
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight
Tight, peace to the ones that don't bite
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight
Now, who be writing rhymes all night
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight

Smash your clique in

One-two, one-two
Your whole crew I dismantle
Rock fly gear and stay clear of sex scandals
With drogues to spark wait for shows to start

Y'all must be out y'all muthafuckin' minds
It's the nigga in me (x4)
You must've bumped yo muthafuckin' head
It's the nigga in me (x4)
They gon' read it and weep
They wanna wake a sleepin' giant that ain't even asleep
Playin' w/ my 7 D's, and my PS3
I kept hearin' my name, I said let me see
""The bitch might be a nigga, for reala, she Rah Digga""
What the fuck man?
This guy, you barely caught a meal short of fish fry
Think I'm lettin' this fly, Fat Trel can kiss my
Global rap ass, he barely out of D.C
Tried to look him up, he ain't even got a wiki
On his records gettin' cheeky, tryna throw some shee shee
I'm right at the door, like when a dog's gotta pee pee
Some say it's beneath me, I should be the bigger artist
But this what happens when you get a nigga get started
The veterans, I love the referange
I love to talk slick, I love to reprimand
Dudes sayin' my name, I come like candy man
Made Nightmare on E Street, more like Candy land
Have them rhymes you be spittin', sound like Rhythm and Blues
Mel Gibson, what he did to them Jews
This Waka Flocka mixed with Choppa, done forgot what Rah Digga could do
Such a lady and I'm still more nigga than you
""You remind me of Rah Digga
A bitch rappin' like a nigga
Or was it a nigga rappin' like a bitch?!""
Y'all invoked that spirit, and them raw ass lyrics
From the only female too raw to compare it
To most of these rap dudes that claim they so street
I don't think I'm that rough, I think niggas too sweet
Soccer mom harder than y'all, man that's pitiful
Now I understand why rap is so ridiculed
Went up on twitter, and I found these jokers
Sits em on my next chapter, sit em down like Oprah
I'm like Yo Gabba Gabba, this no laughin' matter
This grown woman swagger, to you monkey rap bastards
Keep it in your own bracket, don't get too erratic
This Hunger Games shit, I use you for practice
Fuck is you creatin', son, a whole generation
Of some, hey horton, skateboardin', worshippin' satan asses
Bingin' on drugs, somebody get me the gloves
I don't think they need deals man, I think they need hugs
And I was trying to support this young black man
It's too bad you probably lost your only black fan
From now on, keep anointing ointment and ???
Take it any further, and you might catch a backhand
BITCH
See, you don't have to like me
You don't gotta listen to my shit

A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
And it ain't gon' be pretty, now let me paint the picture
So we can do it hit style, by whipping out the slammers
Or we can go medieval, with spear, shanks and hammers
Now anyway you want it, a bitch is gonna get ya
You playing Daredevil, I'mma be that bitch Elektra
Now you can't even measure, you such a pretty gal
A dropkick from me feeling like a fifty cal'
A bitch is gonna get ya, this really could get dirty
Box cutter in heels, seals thirty thirties
You wanna call my bluff, ya'll nowhere near tough
My shank turn furry Kangols to some earmuffs
Make 'em all scatter like roaches
A bitch is gonna get ya, now who is that approaching
Somebody trynna see me, these jokers miss the memo
They better about face, 'fore they going out the window
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
I'm jumping in your whip like that crazy ass Hitcher
Sliced ear to ear like F.U. haters
Except you ain't getting saved by no Caped Crusaders
Saying to yourself, yeah that bitch crazy
Think Green River Killer mixed in with John Gacy
Your hits don't phase me, they make me laugh
Now watch me go smack a bitch with my period pad
I said a bitch is gonna get ya, but ya'll already knew that
I catch another body every time I write a new rap
How many of ya'll can do that, you know it's only one of me
All of ya'll for cop shifty, ya'll just some wannabes
A bitch is gonna get ya, you know a bitch coming
It's not T-Pain, when you hear that thing humming
Fully automatic, coming right out the spinner
Call it lead lipo, make that ass look thinner
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, like Wendy with the gossip, or even Miss Info
With all her little topics, little blogging
Yeah, ya'll all know, trynna match O stacking all that Harpo dough
That chick with McCain, since Hilary out the picture, how can I put it bluntly
A bitch is gonna get ya, Digga Digga
Say peace when you see her, that ready to beat her, shit gets uglier

Then use you as a tool for my misplaced anger
The dude ripper, cuz they don't even see me come out
I blind side 'em, 'fore they can even get they guns out
Now who next to try, who next to die

Dirty Harriet! Yeah!
Where's my sisters?
Where's my sisters?
This one's for the brothers
The brothers, the brothers
Said I be rappin' for da ladies
What's up ladies?
But this one's for da brothers
The brothers, the brothers
Yeah check it out now
Now I'm the baby in the family
And I got three siblings
Three older brothers and we trying to make a living
So we hustle and we bubble
And we coming up fast
Ain't gon' never be the same
Since mom and pops past
The oldest one, child prodigy no doubt
Every since he was a kid used to ride a bitch out
All grown up now
Nice job, nice clout
Nice wife, nice house, try-na take the right route
Treat sis like a queen brother gave me everything
Any time I got in trouble he could probably pull some strings
Walk daddy's footsteps and career same speed
Made the greatest big brother and a father to his own seed
(Uh-oh) But something happened on the job, he started snappin'
Problems with the wifee, winging out and started cappin'
Tried to turn himself in just to make things right
Ended up taking flight cause he's not the jail type
The lesson of today
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say

Rah Digga...remains raw

(Ya hear me, huh?)
Now I got a second brother me and this one was closer
Made me a little tom boy like he was supposed to
Tearing up the place blowing weed in my face
Irresponsible to death parents stayed on his case
Probably cause he wanted to be the baby in the family
Drinking with his friends, macking up
Mommy carried me, look half way crook getting crazy on the mic
Wasn't really into rap but the shit sound tight
He used to tell me all the time
Don't wet none sis
By this time next year we gon' be dumb rich
That's when I heard the ill
My physical got killed
Just a couple of weeks after signing a record deal
Now somebody gots to bust and have to get a little tough
And on the block round the clock
Niggas ain't seen nothing
Yeah right
Never seen a brother more determined or eager
Moms and pops couldn't see it
Now we not gonna see it either

Now my last and final brother, kinda something out the norm
Some say part depressed some say part deformed
Record unclean since his early teens
In and out the youth house
Playing all the crime scenes
Early hangin' with fiends smoking all types of things
He used to chase a basketball now he chasing pipe dreams
From the door, shit was wrong undetected too long
Bugged out when he was little
Now he big that was wrong
Little too early had to kick him out the house
He just wanted some attention that's what dad was all about
He used to bust down the door
Moms cry, pops fight
Even family counseling couldn't make this shit right
Word on the street every body wanna do him
]From his so-called boys to all the chickens he was screwin'
Anybody get the chance, who will probably unload?
How much longer sis got before the last brother gone
OH NO!

Shit we carry, will have you found layin down somewhere damp and muddy
Split your tummy, puncture your kidney and make you piss bloody
So now I leave your body to rott
Where bitches sell they pussy for rock
Cook they coke in steamin water boil in a pot
Do you know niggas like us that clutter they watch
Invest in yo' block, like it or not, involvin your pops
You messin wit a rhyme surgeon
Trade the GS for the Excursion, heads is turning
Flipmode we still mergin
Now we splurgin in Suburbans
Dirty Harriet rock the camouflage turbans
Said one for the money and two for mic check
And spit a million rhymin words in 240 seconds
Get three to get your bitch neck, and four to even the score
Graveyard shift it's best that y'all believe in the law
Flipmode like Mary Lou Retton

Cause friction, every chick I stick my dick in
I'm not trustworthy like midnight I'm pickin
Spliff keep it warm like wool caps to mittens
Watch for me in a new milli, kick up dust with my shoe shitty
New Jack City, wicked ways move wit me
Holla mine, any violent times crooks bear malice
White collar crime, Columbine, we clear classes
Burn a nigga into ashes, how I mashes ass like Cassius
Finger jabs, I got it mastered, fantastic
Writin half ass shit, splash kids
Poke em with the bassonet in the neck, graphic
Can't tell I'm from QB the way that I talk
Speakin in tongue, with six blocks callin my dun
Bogie collapsed lung, big and small gats we brung
Bangin your drums with hot shit and more to come

C'mon!
I be that house nigga squatting in the lab
Rhymes comin, rhymes goin like I was a dollar cab
Fingerin' the math, tryin' to tap into the spirits
Of misguided souls whoo ain't checkin for the lyrics
Many different players, only one hold the ball
Ghetto fabulous chick, go against the protocol
With the grittiest lingo, still such a little sweetheart
Book educated with a whole lotta street smarts
Follow me now, as I build my fanbases
Makin rappers worry like they got open cases
Harriet Thugman, bout to see shit through
Like a whole world of people wait for Episode Two
I be the rap purist, the walking hip hop thesaurus
The innovator, spawned from Libra and Taurus
Do away cats with the same ol' whack
Lead a nation up north where the real party at
A place where we spray when our asses get older
No shots in the throat, no gettin pulled over
A place where graffiti ain't considered a crime
And your favorirte underrated MC's is primetime
A land good and fruitful, where lyrics free people
Black presidents, and all the weed legal
No rich or poor, we break bread and drink merry

I'm primetime, you a local on cable
I battle you on yo' shit and then invoice your label
Hit you wit heat sweeter than vanilla candy
Flip it type wicked like Cinderella family
(For what) For tryin to step to a Rah situation
Less rhymin years, less formal education
Gettin less spins than a BBS
Less hype in the streets and you writin even less
(Now you ain't fresh) MC's goin crazy
(Nah, you ain't a fresh) Ya'll could never out-blaze me
Less knowhow, more ho now
Stay up out of grown folks biz 'fore I show you what broke is

Hard foul the opposition or strangle the coach
I be stashin marijuanna in my Dolce & Gabana
Dead em like gamma, if they don't have no manners
Call the dopest MC my little junior
Playin the game and be a coach like Tuna
Mad, what I say go, B-girl original

I'm fresher than that, and that new shit you tryin to write
Like mira, mira, name not Rashita
Battle on the streets so when I'm playin señorita
Spend a few pesos on some chili con queso
Thinkin how I used to wax rappers back that eso
Be in San Juan, on the carriage like I'm Cam'Ron
Wit a nigga tryin to chew my tampon with my pants on
I'm gettin money off the books like I'm Beatnuts
Make em sign pre-nups, word to my C-cups
Fuck with they heads like Kahlua, milk and vodka
Then tell they punk ass to move on like Silkk the Shocker
Word to my godfather, who bombs harder
Be out to get the paper like Inga and Shawn Carter
All you MC's better stand your ground
Cuz when Digga come around it's curtains
Curtains, curtains, curtains, curtains, curtains

Raisin my voice, I see some bitch and start a cat fight
Or in my travels, grabbin slices from S'Barro's
Eyein fake niggas like they intimate apparel
20,000 seaters, heads givin me pounds
Even biggin me for shit I did for Lyricist Lounge

Playin me close so I can hook you up with Busta
Fuck an entourage, I'm the bitch that roll dolo
More still than mo-mo's and a 4-4 on my polo
With the toaster, make ya run like Sammy Sosa
Could take about 50 MC's like Tony Tocca
Why you take it there? Cuz I'm fruitier than kiwi
And when I freestyle you ain't gon hear it on my CD
Money management, cuz I'm grown up and older now
Drinkin mad low and brow, tell em how it's goin down
Bricks, Bricks, cuz I was born in the Bricks
Bricks, Bricks, and shit is on in the Bricks
Come at me twisted if ya think you got the heart to
But you better be careful what you say like Sparkle
Bricks, Bricks, you get jacked in the Bricks

Paper chase them self, or say man blood money
Schemin' ass honey tryin' to get my shine
Such a lady of grace, with such a hood frame of mind
Summertime's here, Daisy Dukes are in order
Swingin' with my cousin a little thick, a little shorter
Five in the whip, we like to flow thick
CD's in a clip, let's take a road trip
Sayin' what we gonna do now, dice some trees
Take a ride in the Range through the block and skeez
We conceited asses, wavin' to the masses
Cats doin' wheelies on they bikes fly past us
Headin' to the mall or maybe to Phil's
Steady cruisin' down 5th, through one chat and the grill
Stores closin', down goes the sun
Everybody get ready, here comes the real fun
(Ah, ooh)
Yeah y'all, you know what's goin' down
Jumpin' in the whip and we rollin' around town
Wildin' out see ya layin' all on the ground
Mre heat and there's plenty to go around
Party people come shake it over here, just bounce
Got chu' throwin ya hands all in the air, just bounce
Everybody go shake it over there, just bounce
Blowin' the spot up like we don't care (Ah, ooh)

I'm a socializer, y'all know my steez
Whether mountin' at Spagra or grimey at Speed
Ya might see me solo or with a bunch of dimes
Or ridin' shotgun when I'm jottin' punch lines
Or maybe with the squad, Rah, and BK style
First lady profile, no more chicks allowed
Sayin' what we gonna do now, blow the set
Take a ride down to Philly, check grand and Moet
But back to the bricks, have drinks at my bar
I'm the real ghetto superstar
We bring the night to a close
Downed a couple shots and we threw a couple bows
What we gonna do now, take it down
No, after-hours on the other side of town (HO!)
Come on swing with me if ya able
Corner reserved and they gotta pool table
The music jumpin' better than the club
Champagne in the house, every DJ show love
But all good things must come to end
Headed back to the whip, turn parking lot pimp
Just when ya thought it couldn't get no thicker
Shorty gotta hurl, says she can't hold liquor

And it's only for the thick skin
Runnin' round in chick-lands circuit with my Bricks-man
When it come to spittin', got that sixth sense
And I don't think they know the difference
And I'm getting at my wit's end
And then that real rap kicked in
And they wonder how it missed them
Verse 1:
I'm Angela Davis, I ain't shaking my buns
I'm yelling power to the people and waving 'em guns
I be pumping dat fist, I ain't running some shit
It ain't too many o' you broads got the stomach for dis!
Y'all worry 'bout your stylist, worry 'bout your talents
Build up your valence, expandin' your palettes
Better find you a balance else that homegoing won't be
As turned up as Howard's
Verse 2:
Ha! Call me Angela Davis
In my all black floating through the Matrix
They like, “Digga, can you save us?”
When did lyricism escape us?
You one of the few that kept it raw through the ages
You ‘bout the culture even more than the papers
And you ain't have to do that fake shit
I love my black features, I ain't tryna get no facelifts
Verse 3:
I'm Angela Davis, no perm
Momma had that straightin’ comb on slow burn
They ‘on't know about ME, but they gon' learn!
They gon' learn!!
How I had the infallible Lauryn Hill lighting roaches on the mic
Told Kim we read' enough, we not doing ladies night
Told Rage we success, we gon' be Nas and Jay
And the duets with Bust’, still his best to this day
Chorus:
I'm Angela Davis, I ain't, y’all say
Couple war scar flaws from my young day
Album ain’t debut number one, two or three
But I showed you how to be an emcee
Call me Angela Davis, I'm steppin' with pride
Y'all condone the coonin’, I ain't lettin' it ride
Y'all so foo-foo, even the who's who
I swear to God they ‘on't make 'em like they used to
I'm Angela Davis!
Outro:
KRS One (Sample):
I freed myself but I'm coming back to free my brothers and sisters
That ain't for everybody

Or with the swerve don't be spending no cash

Now tell everybody how we keep it on lock
Now where we headed when the block get hot

Dipping down the block when the cops get behind us
Now tell everybody where you heard it all first

Wicked, wicked flows, make a nigga grill drop
Caramel complexion, Feldsburg section
Ready for whatever 'case I'm dealin with some next shit
Rhymin type scenario, niggas only fell
Stay dipped with Nike Airs, Oakleys, and pony tails
Fuckin up some pizza, overcharge my Visa
Million dollar videos, crushin with my tiza
Tell them motherfuckers, I'm tight like Ebeneezer
Scrooge, still look good without ruge
My lipstick, lil misfit, quick to dish shit
Little bit conceited, whole lot consistent
Money, money, money, how we blaze
Splittin shit three ways with me, Zee and Pace
Got bitchasses that think I sound like a dude
Flip rhymes so quick you might think I'm test tube
HOOK:
In the showdown, how it go down
Get the flow down, watch it go down
How it go down, in the showdown
Gettin closed down, watch em go down
In the showdown, how it go down
Put your dough down, watch it go down
I'm representin bitches 'round the way
We runnin up his box and we ain't gon have to pay
I'm runnin with my mens, I rock a pair of Timbs
With rhymin on the brain like scarves and hairpins
I'm tryin to see a black Benz with my back end
House on the hill with my publishin deal
Shows pay the bills, make it all connect
And do some corporate type shit with my royalty check
Now what comes next, grab myself a Bex
After sex, I tune in to Funkmaster Flex
Then I pop up at Stretch, freestyle to death
And give a shout out to my mens like I was D-M-X
Spit rock type, hot like, jazz or funk now
Throw a spoken word or we turn into a hoedown
Tell me now cuz that's how I ball
'Bout a hundred rhymin niggas up in the U-Haul
HOOK
Peace to all my peoples in mission
Peace to peoples with they license suspended
Peace goes out to all my hoodrat chicks
Who ain't tryin to hear shit but nicks and fat dicks
What, I rock hoods and I be good like Foxy
Then hit the sushi bars eatin akros with Saki
I'm smokin damn good and chokey black
Niggas know the pokey fat, now all my ex-boyfriends want me back
I rip shows, and sip Tequila Rose
And always be around like I was afros

Let's go, ladies
Do it
You don't want it baby (tell me why, tell, tell me why)
You don't want it baby (tell me why, tell, tell me why)
You don't want it baby (tell me why, tell, tell me why)

You don't want it baby (tell me why, tell, tell me why)
Baby, baby, (tell, tell me why, tell, tell me why)
Put it on, what went wrong, something's happening to my brain
Something strange, can't explain since I got up in this game
Think I'm bugging, call me rugged, this before I had my name
People fussing, brand new cousins, 'nough to drive a bitch insane
Tell me why do I sacrifice my family and my friends
Thought the struggle would be over, finding out it just begins
Call me crazy, leave my baby, and be traveling on my way
Round the clock, making stops to make somebody else's day
I found myself stressing over ignorant things
I had to realize all the hate that negativity brings
It's like wherever the day takes me now
Can't be that perfect girl, I don't even know how
Put it on, what went wrong, something's happening around the way
Watching roots and hip hop culture breaking down from day to day
Tell me why, where's the love, all the turbulence and crime
Tryin' to teach my cousins, Frankly, cause we running out of time
The government done found themselves the perfect remedy
Three strikes, give them life, and give the rest immunity
Wanna cry, tell me why, is all these babies in the street
Little girls is barely teens, and they done had more sex than me
I found myself stressing over ignorant things
I had to realize all the hate that negativity brings
It's like wherever the day takes me now
Can't be that perfect girl, I don't even know how
Now now now
Don't even know how I'm supposed to be
Motivated by the love of those close to me
While I'm steady on the west, trying to make my ends
Turning friends to enemies, and enemies to friends
Every lesson I've learned, try my best just to show you
Acting like I owe you and I don't even know you
Before it get better, I see it getting worse
So before the struggle do me
Holla do me first
Look, thank you LaFace, and I feel so out of place
It's like constant confusion, and I always feel like I'm losing
Something telling me to be strong, something's telling me to go on
Sayin' P!nk, come now let's do this song
Rah Dig', and it's going on
I found myself stressing over ignorant things
I had to realize all the hate that negativity brings
It's like wherever the day takes me now

Digga, Digga, nuttin' nice when I take the stand
Boss chick like Saw with Sean and Beanie Man (Uh)

Better call , maybe they might pay you
In the hood, no question who work the best
Connects for everything, from dro to percocets, shorty surf the net
Spots in   that'll turn a snowboard into a four door (Huh)
Post up in V.I., boogie bitch
Cats come in both sides, like ""excuse me, Miss""

Party over here
The way things are lookin', blood might spill
'Cause this dumb ass nigga
Paid 40 dollars to come in and ice grill
Me, I'm in the back higher than a light bill
Chick grinding on the kid, high off a white pill
I'm tryna get a lil play then I'm out
You ain't tryna conversate, you should'a stayed in the house
We both know, I'm tryna get you layed on the couch
4:00 on the dot, kids sprayed in your mouth
Meanwhile, I'm the bitch that blaze up a ounce
Looking all decked out, with a blade in my pouch
Make me spill my drink, get layed the fuck out
Acting like you don't know, how much I paid for this blouse
Got a bitch  (Uh)
Real live shortys (Yea)
Whip fast and compact like them 5-40's (OK)
Stayin in watching CNN, I think not

I'd like (D-I) to shout out my manager Ace Lentz, (This album is)
Let's do this, Megahertz, (2000, D-I)
Flipmode Squad, Busta Rhymes
Outsidaz reppin the bricks
Nobody on the track. (D-I)
Yo, When I step in the booth, Flip ugly and I loose all couth
Dig-ga be-have
Maintained the streets, Next journey still with the same peeps
Dig-ga be brave
Ima do this son, Dirty Harriet number one, (Come on)
Dig-ga we straight
Got somethin for you and you and you, Man what's my name yo, (D-I) G-G-A
As we start round two, Next rhyme might be about you
Hope you never see the light, Like Juwanna Man 2
I'm still makin sure, All my rhymes is tight
Tell you that from day one like they tell us God is white
Imperial chick from Brick City, Doin a buck fifty
Rollin around in trucks strictly
When it's time to break fools, My rhyme styles dagger
Tare you down worse then the O'Riley factor
Do it for my sake, I dare yall to try me
Burn yall up the ass like cancer in the prostate
Best in the tri-state, Perhaps in the country
Headline with no album, That's how bad niggas want me
Might be a little raw, For the average broad
Don't worry baby girl, I got somethin for yall as well
Do tell, Cause everything's a story
It's your favorite little grimey, But my name ain't NORE
It wasn't the way she rapped, It was a talent
God gave it a she brought it back
Tell Bust I said peace
Flipmode flip dough, Zip codes, Go back home on skid row
Niggas don't like Tone
Or you digga, Handle they bitch and I'll get the nigga
Develop that into a real picture, Click
Niggas get that shit, I don't play that shit
I concentrate on hits, Not that BET
Nigga bodies or an ill album, Or a song for them ill mommies
I swear I will dot theses niggas the fuck out
Get to cussin and cuttin, These corny cocksuckers better stop frontin
Word, Blow yall niggas for damn near nothin
We-Got, Yo let them things pop, We got the mean darts
Cheese-Blocks, We the welfare babies with the dark brown birth marks
Don't get your assed up, Fuck that

35505,Rah Digga,So Cool,"(That cool shit)
Call me conductor, I lead the way for ya
Underground vibe, status self-employed
R-A-H aka Harriet Thugman
Carry out the legacy with seed and husband
Now off with the head thangy
Watch flip to a genie
And I be a Mac like Beanie
Out the bottle, I turn thug super model
With rhymes that'll make ya have to settle for Movado
The dirtiest getting all the way live
Steady tappin' my shit, try-na eat while I drive
Speeding to a function to play the little actress
Three hours late and don't even know the address
Madness with the ill sexy flow
And the label spendin' g's not tryin' to let me go
Rockin' on the stage after me, YOU FOOL!
Cause I am so cool
(Rah Digga)
Cause she's so cool, yeah oh
Money baby can't you see
(Can't you see, can't you see)
She's so cool
And you can't be as fly as she
(Never be as fly as me)
I aim high beat date in December
A million motherfuckers whose face I don't remember
Next to fall with the b-girl ball
Tight gear little cousins
The store from the mall
Rockin' hardcore to some R&B shit
Kickin' rhymes for the round-the-way heads
That I'm at peace with
Love the ice rock silver as a preference
Taking writer's credit so offer a suggestion
So bust dem heads who ain't real wit it
Who don't want shit in life and can't deal with it
I see you
Frontin' like you on my side
Switch sides thanks for the ride bitch
See me on the cover, (Say what?) strike a pose
Just know after that I'm making off with the clothes
Underground rule for real, so what's the haps?
Take it back like kids who fight in playing caps
Or Jacks 'N' Ball, freestyle off the wall
Tell em don't forget the stones when they make the Digga dome
Do away with styling you ain't even found yet
Blow the mic out and ain't nothing but a sound check
Writing rhymes like you wish you could
Tight breaking em down on behalf of sisterhood
Spittin' every time use my looks as a tool
Cause I am so cool

It’s a storm comin’
It’s a, it’s a storm comin’
What you gon’ do, who can you trust?
When you feel the heat comin’, are you ready to bust?
If we have to, if we have to, feel that heat comin’
If we have to, if we have to, feel that heat comin’
If we have to
Dear son, hope you hearing every word in my chronicle
Hope it’s finding you in good health, living honorable
Caught a glimpse of the future and it don’t look bright
You gon be in for one hell of a plight
It’s a war going on outside, no art is safe from
They let you take some, unlike that mason
OG, my straight spit from day one
They tell you switch it up, just keep the faith son
Don’t let em digitize you, epitomize you
He’s just another nigga with a mic, telling lies to
Unsuspecting fans, be a self-respected man
Remember mommy’s tales of PE and ex clan, bam
Fast forward to the present day debacle
They bring you underground when you want to preach the gospel
That 13th apostle, that wasn’t on the roster
Found out that I was a female, and that they couldn’t stop her
Your mama was a soldier, heavy burden on my shoulders
Still be spitting, spitting, spitting if I had to do it over
They forever tried to terminate me
Underrate me, believed they should date me, even tried to percolate me
Now here comes the safety, but none of them could tackle
Occasional snaffle, I wave that magic lasso
Whipping up them bars, niggas craved it like the castle
Feeling the heat coming, start busting if you have to
I don’t know where to begin, how to tell you how to win
But I do know it’s gon come down to those rhymes in the end
Some pursue other ventures, some lost they step
We done came a long way from the days of salt and pep
They told me shake sells, I took the red pill
I chose to stay street, let culture prevail
I agreed to the weave,  the ponytail
Girls nipping and tucking, I said what the hell
I ain’t sign up for that, but to each their own
Said it’s easier to market, easier to clone
Easier to brainwash little kids at home
Easy for them machines to set the tone
Now some say it’s high class, some say it’s hoochie
All up in the mags, free stuff in the two piece
First comes the nip slip, then comes the new leaks
Then comes the sex tape, if I’m lying sue me
I ain’t need nothing but a pen and some loose leaf
Speakers on blast, whipping round in that two seat
Jumping out, bam, show time, just me and the band
Mic checking in my B girl’s stance
Fuck cocaine, fame is a hell of a drug
How far you gon go tryna get that buzz
How many you gon fuck tryna get that plug
In the future are you still gonna get that love?
Ladies!
Thank you Rah Digga
No more silence or violence, just guidance
And let a mother be heard with that true word
No matter how much the powers that be be disturbed
And if it is what it is
Let us define our kids
Make strong daughters, in the ending story of our sons

My Outsida click gon' get the last word
(Pacewon)
Our attitude is like a bad sitcom, nuttin funny
Slap you like you stole something from me
Yo we got raps by the page like Bill Gates got money
*Along w/Rah Digga* First week out we top twenty, grungy
(Young Zee)
Dummy Young Zee, come get your mouth injured
Diss us, watch I ?pop willies? without ninjas
(Axe)
Run your ? wit ya for the Brick City niggas
Shittin on ya like kitty litter
(?)
You could do fifty situps, and I don't give a fuck if he bigger
I throw a right hook that could drop any nigga
Ya'll rock jewels that's Truck like Chevy pickups, TWISTA
(Pacewon)
All I want is money and my dick sucked
Chorus
(Az-Izz)
Az-Izz got bad nerves, rank matters
While you serve steak platters I'ma die ballin like Hank Gathers
(Axe)
Axe get the dough like cake batter
Pockets stay fatter
The way you rhyme makes me think that you the gay rapper
(Pacewon)
Face slapper like Roy Jones, I throw a bolo
Break your team up like Chris Shwartz and Joe Niccolo
(Slang Ton)
Rippin a beige Volvo, bumpin a Slang promo
We sign our autographs, Spell It Out like K-Solo
Tha Outz straight to disk, too hot for tape or phono
(Rah Digga)
Takin photos wit the black and gray Polo's
Ruinin niggas lives like they K-Ci or JoJo
(?Nawshis?)
Outsidaz takin a loss, that's a no-no

Steady puffin on brown just for the time being

Chicken heads trying to front like they not Digga fans

(That cool shit)
Call me conductor, I lead the way for ya
Underground vibe, status self-employed
R-A-H aka Harriet Thugman
Carry out the legacy with seed and husband
Now off with the head thangy
Watch flip to a genie
And I be a Mac like Beanie
Out the bottle, I turn thug super model
With rhymes that'll make ya have to settle for Movado
The dirtiest getting all the way live
Steady tappin' my shit, try-na eat while I drive
Speeding to a function to play the little actress
Three hours late and don't even know the address
Madness with the ill sexy flow
And the label spendin' g's not tryin' to let me go
Rockin' on the stage after me, YOU FOOL!
Cause I am so cool
(Rah Digga)
Cause she's so cool, yeah oh
Money baby can't you see
(Can't you see, can't you see)
She's so cool
And you can't be as fly as she
(Never be as fly as me)
I aim high beat date in December
A million motherfuckers whose face I don't remember
Next to fall with the b-girl ball
Tight gear little cousins
The store from the mall
Rockin' hardcore to some R&B shit
Kickin' rhymes for the round-the-way heads
That I'm at peace with
Love the ice rock silver as a preference
Taking writer's credit so offer a suggestion
So bust dem heads who ain't real wit it
Who don't want shit in life and can't deal with it
I see you
Frontin' like you on my side
Switch sides thanks for the ride bitch
See me on the cover, (Say what?) strike a pose
Just know after that I'm making off with the clothes
Underground rule for real, so what's the haps?
Take it back like kids who fight in playing caps
Or Jacks ‘N' Ball, freestyle off the wall
Tell em don't forget the stones when they make the Digga dome
Do away with styling you ain't even found yet

Gettin’ hit with lead instead of ex on his mystery night
Doin’ a hundred and ten, we gettin’ blunted again

Prissy does it gully like whatever will suit me
I’m pourin’ liquor for my dead homies
That’s what it just suit me (Clinton Sparks)
On some independent shit, just to see how to try it
Fuckin’ wit’ cops with seven dollars ‘til I learned they was lyin’
Cops said then fuck it I don’t need ‘em all these labels be gamin’
I’d rather be a free agent than bein’ signed and complainin’
Be steady cryin’ then boohooin’ they ain’t market the record
I ain’t too beat I’m in the street wit’ all the cushion them x’s, you see
Flipmode be runnin’ this shit, you just be runnin’ your lip
You be makin’ records on some springy and summery shit
Long as I been quiet had a bitch ain't dependin'
And if I ever had to battle silly hoe you ain’t winnin’
I bet that made the people they day wanna see I still got it
I say some shit that turn you bluer than a case of hypnotiq, now
Don’t make me flip in this bitch, know how Jersey niggas get
If I get the flash then better know that it won’t be a tick
Give it to him and his chick, more like extendin’ a clip
If we squashed the beef then hoe well I’m rekindlin’ shit

Salutes to action be the latest en-t-ry for 'Illadel colonies
To get the cream like cherries jubilee
My steeze put you at ease like methamphetamine
Or like Tony Starks fantasies about his Wallabees
Too fitting, ya mean? Big East be comin' through
Ghetto magic plus the bullies back it what
Me now Buddah Blessed for I-and-I provide the greatest na-tural
Pure as life that exit from the gentile
Styles international like direct connects from internet
Verbal text blossom like Chia Pets
Perfect with the mic devices Bahamadi' be the nicest
Bringin' this rap thing to the light like Osiris
For the Nine pound et cetera
Peace to Gang Starr and my nigga K-Sarrah
""We gonna rock this motherfucker like Three The Hard Way""
Ayo, I'm doing this for the crews claimin' that they're better
I'm tickled, ya must be like Sanford on the ripple little by little
I kick verses of the middle of my brain
The Riddler couldn't fuck wit Kannon Riddles, I remain
The undisputed, you should've known if you knew it
Montell couldn't tell you how we do it
If you got the chance to even do the battle dance with the Kannon Band
Shit be slammin' more than Larry Nance
And plus it's in me to give you more like Demi
I do it easy, leave the hard-a-way to penny
As I display skills for what it's worth
Sent to this Earth to put the curse of wack MCs upon my turf
This is the end like Armageddon, you're settin' a bad example
Niggas still using samples times ample
Yo Swift never said she was the baddest but I kept it real
You niggas frontin', talkin' 'bout you packin' steel
You be sportin' a foot all up in rectum
By them Central kids sittin' all up in the bully section

Do you remember those you chose to forget
Back when ya ears was wet?
And now ya preachin' me releasin' mini-tec
I need a mic check because the static comes sporadic
Emcees be hooked like addicts while casualties stay tragic
There ain't no glamour in that story, all guts no glory
Entranced in jealousy just like the suckers who abhor me
They tell but they don't know the core
So raw is now my reference
Like Mumia there is no evidence to say I am more than I am
Undbending, never ending similar to million men
Me say ""just us"" you say ""me bust bust""
Mental stagnation like the cancer patients eatin' cow fuss
As the minds rust
From dawn to dusk I rest in Mecca
The words sound power as in energy see Heka
To die because ya black simply be no cause at all
Surreality just like the legends of the fall
Initial looks of the shook hearted kids who shouldn't have started
Lyrics leave like spirits and the waters Moses parted
Do or Die's ya slogan but niggas slip with Trojans
Major mental corrosion like Murray's meat unfrozen
I am the Chosen, Earth, Sun, Moon and stars
Hard for me to find a top contender just to spar
Some peep the exterior and think inferior
Next ya know they callin' for a Sound Bwoy Burial
D&D Studio be wicked, catch wreck for infinity
One love peace to Bahamadi'
Like Salt-N-Pepa I take it to the next plateau
Niggas scream they what this Brown Sugar like D'Angelo
I make it better for fanatics fienin' for the butter, boo
Like 25-to-lifers do from lack of gettin' Power-U
Oh, I put my little thing in action, smooth like satin
Or Special Ed when he was taxin'
Heads relax and play the back when I spill
I regulate a flow like chicks on birth control pills
Ill antics, keep it movin' on
Bouncin' like nylon from 'Illadel to Lebanon (no doubt)

I'm reclinin' out West, maxin' at the ress
Pressed to see my cutie that I call to come caress me
Desperate pooh unavailable to check this
Not into masturbating yo 'cause that's some other shit
Since I had hit the dry spell I figured I'd manicure my nails
Then out the blue I'm interrupted by the bell
It was K talkin' bout D
""C'mon let's bounce tonight, Wu-Tang performin' at the Fever
And I got the backstage passes, VIP status
Tha afterparty's at the Marriott, we in the night like Gladys""
Cool I can do with that
Give me 45 so I can wash the pussy cat
And marinade the body, hop in Mizarahi
Tighten up the afro and turn to superhottie
I tell you what, I'll hit you up soon as I'm ready
When I see your Mitsubishi out front we jettin'
True honey buns, wanna have fun
Unlike a chick who settle for the hit and run, yeah
To all tha girls do what you gotta do
But it ain't what you do - it's how you do it (you do it)
Arrivin' at the club like 11:45, scenery was live
Mob like a 3-2 center outside, fly rides, the whole shabang
You know how Philly hang come time they get extravagant
While I was sidetrackeded by the glamour and the glitz
Key was chattin' with the bouncer telling' him we on the list
Within a split second we escorted through congestion
Routine friction, metal detection, all clear as air, no question
So we grabbed Kahluas at the bar
And head towards the dance section, no hesitation
Breeze into the back
In the green room where the celebrities was at
That's when the propaganda began to emerge
Star stud events must trigger hoochie alerts
'Cause Kia went berserk, diggy low at first
Subtle body language actin' like a flirt
Tongue stickin' out wit the baby doll pout
Talkin' all loud, I'm like what's dis all about?
There go Method Man
I'm sayin' what's up with him?
I'm tryna see him fo' real, they look good
Why you lookin' at me like that?
I'm sayin' I got to get mine
Fo' real, I got to get mine, okay?
Here come the raw maneuver, lewder than imagined
Kia aimin' for attention, strivin' for it with a passion
Slips out her sarong, started dancing in her thongs
Like a bootie song was on, I said ""Sis, you know you wrong
See you the reason nigs be screamin', 'Bitches, hoes and tricks'
I don't believe you goin' out on that Adina Howard shit
Don't you think these niggas think you hotter than the Sun?
Even if they talk to you they wanna hit and run
And if you schemin' on the cream, boo
You ain't gettin' none, you played from the door
With that nut shit you done""
Then she gon' look at me and say ""Yo, chill whatever"" (Whatever)
""I thought you was my peeps,"" I said, ""I thought you was together""
Your actions bounce on all these chicks in here like a reflector
I'm tryna school you sis, it's plain that you don't know no better
But I'm not the one to judge, so do what you gotta do
But it ain't what you do - it's how you do it (you do it)
Yo, true honey buns
Wanna have fun
Unlike a chick who settle for the hit and run, yeah
To all the girls do what you gotta do
But it ain't what you do - it's how you do it (it's how you do it)

Straight outta the metro rhythm central
I'm innovative at the intro, 'cause I go slow mo'
But never slow pulse
But never no joke, dope
But never no coke
Spits the riddles like phlegm
Loose with my lyrics like I double jointed them
Twist and I bend, common episodes past freak modes
The monstrous bass beneath my pace be like morse code
Slash, beep, slash, beep, scanners
Zero in to the system in your jeeps
I'm out there with Kool Keith and Ced-Gee and De La
Inventors of my third seeing eye
The futuristic vision, I'm not among loony nut cakes upon a mission
I gets in where I fit in, 'cause life's too short
So you could all label me weirdo, but yo
I know it's talent
Mad explosive spontaneity
At present I speak the new
Beginning when every other trend fell short
So who'll be the shareholder of my kinda thoughts besides the studious
'Cause the gluteus maximus lack ability
To scoop all capabilities of spontaneity within me
Depicted kicked it true
Vibes pops jazz but collaborated with the cool
Known flows, but unfamiliar grooves that soothe
Individuals' moods like soul food for thought
Mad explosive spontaneity
Rip here be dizz like everybody's on it
'Cause eternal verbal expansion

Perserve my chocolate ties and it's a thrill; I'm sayin'

That entices me not to keep it on the hush-hush
Boy times girl times lust equals us
And you can count on that like you would an abacus so
Bust the equation, baby 'cause I'm facin' the fact that I only think of you
On two occasions, but I'mma max once I get this off my chest
And just let nature do the rest... I confess

Truly do adore, every little move you make and more, my word is bond

Lyrically, my specimen is hard for you to see or examine
Now, dig it! I contaminate the 2-inch tape
Sensimilla in my PA state stimulates the M-I-C ministry
Enemies who enter my chemistry can't cope (What?)
I'm dope like crack, what I wrote broke ya back
So bust the cerebral attack – Bahamadia, where ya at?!
When we're comin' live from the area 2-1-5
The land of the master plan, where the brothers scam and connive
Well, it's the contraband clan, I'm hailin' from the brotherly land
I stand sharp, it started or began at the park
Expanded years and grew into careers
Competition, whut?! Fuck 'em! I cut 'em like shears
It's the un-rehabilitatable or frustratable
I gotta get mine, and that's non-negotiatable
So.. put me on like Donna Karan, and c'mon, uh!
It's da jawn!
When I present my raps on the tracks, kids be like, ""Who dat?""
Sugar be gettin' horror with the foreign for-a-mat
The competition better be easin' back
Like recedin' hairlines on they pops when I drops
Dialect perfected with two lines connected
Pump life into my records like a CPR-uh method
Funk provides my rhymes with amounts of pressin'
Injected like morphine in each lines
Darin' they jeans to come off like silk screen or tank-tops
I rank top-notch and make black vinyl turn butterscotch in coloration

In between my pelvic and my belt, at times, a holster
Most of y'all niggas with ya legislation
Revoke ya recitation and continue with my recitation
Fuck other opinions in my dominion
The throne won as a king from Illadelph, I'm not Virginian
Icons — I will just strangle just like a python
You lust this shit, I leave ya desolate like Saigon
M-to-the-Ill, I show the skill
If your girl cooch stinks, she needs to douche a Massengill
A rebel with the treble like my man Bobby Seale
Or like Da Youngstas and Gang Starr, I got the Mass Appeal
I spill words when ill blurs, still slurge
What's up to P.R. Star, Snuka and Emerge
Come up to the surface, then once you get submerged
To go below because my flow got the urge
Now, we can talk with tones or spark with the guns
However you want it, Allah protects me when confronted
In duck season, with all these quacks that get hunted
If ya ass was a field goal, well, then I'd punt it
I drop topics all on your optics
Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam, waseela The Prophet's
Here's a Bobbitt, but not Loren', you feel the pain still
From 68th Ave. to West Oak Lane, Phills
With Cosmic Kev, and Ran, that's my man
Styles, I got 7, M' pee-pees ya van, damn

And all the borders, even up in Minnesota
Since The Roots put me on, I Remain Calm but stand strong

You ain't really hot, you just image and politics
I'm prototype, you duplicate of male affiliates
Sounding the silliest, doing renditions of hits like Al Yankovic
I never bit, kept it in suspense like a scene outta ""Scream""
Legacy like Nasir Jones, I'm repping for queens
Doing royal things, locking down for offspring
Whole team be a bunch of backpackers and mic fiends
We all first string spitting the jewels that bling bling

Most of these rap cats is barely fresh
And when they carry me, they gon' bury me wit a mic on my chest
With a wide crowd looking
But for now these mic minerals is Ital

Get in the stance and swing hands
Better change the plans, it's not goin down like that

Perhaps we give dap to those that spit flows
Keeping 'em on they toes
Hope it don't come to blows
'cause if it come to that then we laying 'em flat

Ain't no stopping us, ain't no stopping us
A child of the essence, turning degrees into perfection
My struggle is now objective to meet the righteous direction
The life lessons, but what they all about?
If I took the dolo route, and I left the people out
Non-personal connects, low-cost effects
Bound to meet my doom for regrets so I just
Put all praises down to Allah, plus the block
Pull my family ties in one big knot
Respect the divine that makes me help me ride to the top
And do a trip to a past never forgot
""Clap your hands now""
Where I go from here? I don't know, I don't know
Till I find my path, this is life I knew
(This is life I knew) This is life I knew
I'm holding on to my roots cause they pulling my leaves
I traveled overseas, got 400 degrees
It's the city life, trife concoct the scheme
To play apon my dreams still fulfillin' my needs
Well I don't know, whatever happened to my past
Wait I gotta think about (I don't care) how long I can last
I don't know as long as I get over my worlds most biggest fears
Cause I'm drenched in sweat for family tears, so ahh
Where I go from here? I don't know, I don't know
Till I find my path, this is life I knew
(This is life I knew) This is life I knew

Ain't no stopping us, ain't no stopping us
Uh, all in the game a young female
So intelligent and deep like seashells
Uh, I'm from L.A. so I gotta cap to adapt
Plus interact with the black folks
And blowin' smoke ain't never been a problem
It's waking up and facing the drama
Can't let you hang, maintain, run game, pimp thangs
And roll my land cruiser like it's on Danna Danes
Uh, it's show low, the west coaster
You know, let you boost like I'm suppose ta (Like I'm suppose ta)

I'm pure as opposed to the fakes y'all makin legends of
It's ridiculous, showin wack niggas and chickens love
Cause they playin in rotation and constantly gets buzz
But it's aight though, majority rule for this hype so
I play the background until it's my turn to blow
Never jeal', record it like I see it cause my vision swirl
Minus the weave and nails you gettin rawness from Illadelph
Uhh, I bounce the Reebok's, and smoke Hawaiian cheebas
With the ese's, with Pepe's, and the mida's, with Fila's
And come back to lay the vocals
Milky like Total, tighter than Krunch's
I showstop they homegrown like contraceptive sponges
With cutthroat raps, plus I'm fuckin with the SP-1200's
And 950's, when C-Low's fuckin with me
Loop kick snare link it up with the semi
I set warfare like when the doctor yell ""Clear!""
Hits below the belt but no bitin on the ear
I'm worser than a Colt boy with punchlines trife
Battle 40 MC's and make em take they own life
Now what's this talk about a marketing scheme?
Nigga please, I crush all MC's ?sardi deez?

Diverse channels they move through when I will spit influential
Workin on your mental sort of like sermons at holy temples
Neotepic and nimble when deeper than baby dimples
Style the vulture, I laced it so you could observe closely
These opuses unfolding insuring the heads quote me
Off the top of written each time I finesse it I be shittin skill
Infinite, bask in the eloquence internet
You know the repoitoire, ghetto platinum rap star
Sixteen bars of inspiration from Allah rightfully God

Blow up the station if I ain't in rotation (yeah)
Knee deep in patients, on a cowboy ranch
Now I found a new branch, Golden Girl like Blanche

35534,Bahamadia,Paper Thin,"Paper Thin Lyrics
When you say you love me, it doesn't matter
It goes to my head as just chit-chatter
You may think it's egotistical or just worry free
But what you say I take none of it seriously
And even if I did I wouldn't tell you so
I let you pretend to read me, and then you'll know
'Cause I hate when one attempts to analyze
In fact, I despise those who even try
To look into my eyes to see what I am thinking
That dream is over, your yacht is sinking
I tell all of you like I told all of them
What you say to me is just paper thin
(Word... word... yeah, word...)
I'm not the kind of girl that likes to play a man out
To take the money and the gear, and then break the hell out
No, that's not my strategy, it's not that the game I play
I admit I play game but it's not done that way
Truly, when I get involved, I give it my heart
I mean my mind, my soul, my body – I mean every part
But if it doesn't work out, yo, it just doesn't
It wasn't meant to be, you know, it just wasn't
So I treat all of you like I treat all of them
What you say to me is still paper thin
In one ear and right out the other
I heard his mumbo jumbo (Yeah-yeah!)
Lover – I don't pay attention, I don't concentrate
You ain't got the bait that it takes to hook this...
(A-hah, a-hah, a-hah...)
Sucker, you missed, I got feelings inside, I know who I am
Don't take it Lyte; is your name Sam?
'Cause if it is, step off, grab your coat and get lost
And wrap a scarf around your throat
And go back and cast the boat and hit the road, Sam
And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
And hit the road, Sam, and don't you come back no more
Now I take precautions when choosing my mate
I do not touch, until the third or fourth date
And then maybe a kiss on the fifth or sixth
Time that we meet, {*kissing sound*} like this
'Cause a date without a kiss is so incomplete
And then, maybe I'll let you play with my feet
'Cause you could suck the big toe and play with the middle
It's so simple, unlike a riddle
It's as easy as counting to 1, 2, 3
In other terms, the name: MC Bahamadia
Told you, you, you, and all of you in the back
And in the middle and the front – yup

Crazy shout outs to MC Lyte

She had a baby by your ass and you ain't giving no help
Uh-huh, big time hustler, snake motherfucker
One's born every day and every day she was your sucker
How could you beat the mother of your kids?
How could you tell her that you love her, but don't give a fuck if she lives?
She told me she would leave you, I admit it she did
But came back, made up a lie about you missing your kids
Sweet kisses, baby ain't even know she was your mistress
Had to deal with fist fights and phone calls from your bitches
Floss like you possessed her, tellin' me to mind my business
Said that it was her life and stay the fuck out of it
I tried and said just for him I'll keep a ready clip
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
I don't even know you and I want you dead
Don't know the facts but I saw the blood pour from her head
See I laid down beside her in the hospital bed
And about two hours later, doctors said she was dead
Had the nerve to show up at her mother's house the next day
To come and pay your respects and help the family pray
Even knelt down on one knee and let a tear drop
And before you had a chance to get up, you heard my gun cock
Prayin' to me now, I ain't God but I'll pretend
I ain't start your life but nigga, I'ma bring it to an end
And I did, clear shots and no regrets, never
Cops comin' lock me under the jail
Nigga, whatever my bitch, fuck that, my sister
You could never figure out even if I let you live
What our love was all about
I considered her my blood and it don't come no thicker
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind

It's about that time, y'all
Ruff Ryders, you know
Teflon, Eve, woo
Yo, yo, yo
They wanna know
Who's that girl? (Uh, yo, yo, c'mon, c'mon)
Eve's that girl (Uh, yo, yo, yo, uh, c'mon, c'mon)
Who's that girl? (Uh, what's my name, yo? Yo, uh, what's my name, yo?)
Eve's that girl (Uh, uh, c'mon, c'mon, yo, yo)
Can I turn you on by my word spell?
Look into my eyes, think I want you, can't tell
Me, I keep it sexy, daddy, so I can't fail
Keep it gangster for the cowards, so I give 'em hell
Call me misfit, lips spit a gang of trash
Wrist glist' now 'cause I made a gang of cash
Light glam, still street with the durag
Slang, spit game, change speech, how they do that? Huh
Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up and act out
Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
Ain't changed, game don't run me, I run the game
If I gotta keep it gritty, so be it, I'm supposed to change?
Like simple, dizzy broads ain't fuckin' with my mental
Natural born hustlin' bitch, check what I been through
Got mine, took it from you, and now you slot mine
Exec to my own shit, dawg, I'm ownin' dot-coms
Who's that girl? (C'mon, c'mon)
Eve's that girl (Uh, yo, yo, yo)
Who's that girl? (Huh? Uh, uh)
Eve's that girl (Yo, yo)
I can understand why they're scared of Eve
Thought I did it one way, ain't prepared for me, huh
Mad 'cause an image I don't care to be
Realness, real shit, spit reality
Attitude rude, that's the Philly in I
Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life, breath of fresh air
Little boys hang me on they wall, I grow 'em chest hair
Why you listenin' to other shit? You got the best here
Come on, try your luck, shorty, I got the rest scared
Bet you anything you ain't ready and you get left there
Ain't known for frontin', vouch for my behavior
Same way they get down, I get down for this paper
Sixteen mean from my pen, so you can test her
Still need to know who I am, then cop the record
Take it like a class on me and learn the lesson
Bottom line, my world, my way, any questions?
Who's that girl? (Uh, c'mon, c'mon)
Eve's that girl (Uh, yo, yo, yo)
Who's that girl? (Uh, say my name, y'all)
Eve's that girl (Yo)
Power moves is made every day by this thorough bitch
I'ma get this bank any way that I do this shit
I was born to shine, and most of y'all's borderline bullshit
Know exactly what I want for me, you cats is clueless, though
'Spose the flow through my hands like water
Keep stocks growin' for my son or my daughter
Eve want her own cash, fuck what you bought her
He spend, you owe, that's what mommy taught her
So hardball is played, won't starve today
Song after song I write, so I get paid
Thought I wasn't followin' up with the second round
Now, bitch, swallow it up while I shove it down
Make 'em love me over again and over your name
Bet you they get over your style and over your fame
Why you lookin' sad at me? I ain't to blame
Back to plan B, baby, I can feel your pain

‘Gotta Man’… Read More 
I got a boyfriend now *laughs*
C'mon, uh, uh, uh, yo, yo
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him (Yeah)
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him (Yeah)
This nigga lookin' like love
No doubt sophisticated thug keep me guessin'
Said it would be a blessin' just to watch you undressin'
Callin' you daddy, late nights I'm layin' on your chest and
Stay reminiscin' 'bout the rest and, and how they less than
Tryna come between what we share, can't compare (Never)
Could have been left, but when it's mine, I never share
Fight to the death if need be to prove that
Wounds from your wars, other bitches couldn't soothe that
Broke from a bad back, I'm holdin' you down
Doin' dirt with other bitches but them other fishes drown
Locked in, for however long, I'm playin' it smart
Court dates in other cities, there, I'm playin' my part
Wifey, in ya life see forever be us
Passenger side of a Bentley or the number 2 bus
Tell the whole world, papi, Eve don't want nobody else
With other niggas pick and choose, but you, I'm keepin' for myself
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
All my peoples thinkin' I'm delirious, but the love I feel is serious
Couples of the world, no comparing us
Been through fist fights with niggas when I see it escalate
I'm the getaway driver, so my nigga can escape
Pull my ice for the bail, spending nights in jail
Drawing hearts on the wall with our names around the cell
It may be a little craziness, maybe I'm blind
But for me to leave now, lookin' for love would take a lifetime
So I'm keepin' mine, fuckin' keep me blind
Feels like heaven when we makin' love, controllin' my spine
Wine and dine, I don't need that as long as long as you with me
And you bitches thinkin' that you competition, come and get me
My position is held, some try and all fail
Pussy piece a mothafucka, uh-huh, good enough to sell
Never leave his baby girl, mad 'cause he claim me
Only thug in the hood that was wild enough to tame me (C'mon)
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him (Yeah)
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him (Yeah)
I'm the bitch he'll never leave, helped him build his luxuries
Carry stories that can hurt him, still he only trustin' me
Secrets never leave my mouth, even if they torture me
Always taught to hold the ground, that's why I'll always be his queen
Did some dumb shit, see him in the party, start to flip
Curse him out on the regular just to make him sick
Disappear for a day or two to test his loyal ground
Keep my dogs on a short leash, controllin' the growl
Open wide, I don't give a fuck, I'm swallowin' my pride
And he fast to blast a cat that he think be on the prowl
But I'll never let him go, temper flare, let it go
Always be his extra back bone, quick to let a nigga know
Always by his side, Eve the apple in his eye
Us together ain't no stopping snatchin' pieces of the pie
Us together in our own world, what's his becomes mine
Exceed eternity with him we'll stand the test of time (Yeah)
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever

A lot of them be wishin' that they was in my position

Told y'all determined to win
You tryna enter through the back door?
Ain't nothin' happenin', this whole shit is my shit, bitch, and I'm the captain
Can't beat me, join me, baby, then get to clappin'
Bang it in ya whips to get ya neck snappin'
I know you hopin' that I rest so you can breathe
Stressed when we in the same places 'till I leave
Whisper to they friends, ""What they wanna do to me?""
Wish they could erase me, take away the air I breathe
And I feed 'cuz that shit only give me hunger pains
Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame
Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain
And I always been a savage 'bout the fame
Separate the girls from the women and the winnin'
Always knew the thrill was worth it from the beginnin'
Baby, what's the deal? I'm hurtin' 'em how I'm livin'
I gotta conquer it all now the world's my wishin'

High above the clouds
Swear I won't look back if I get chance
Oh, I won't come back around
Yo, have you ever laid in bed and it's late in the night
Staring at the ceiling talking to God about life
Asking when it's gonna happen, just maybe it might
Made a lot of life turns, some wrong and some right
Wanna know when it's your second, your minute, your time
Sick of dreaming, wanna lay the pictures in your mind
Never been like all the others, you're one of a kind
I know you're feeling like you wanna break free, it's a sign
Just wanna fly above it all, see where you can land
Know that you can do it on your own cause you can
Know that you can conquer all with a plan
Forget about the negatives buried in the sand
Yeah, never forget this is your life
Your path, your dream, this is your fight
Victory you'll see, you'll be alright
Get through the darkness, on the other end is pure light

If I get chance
I will come back around

I gotta make it out this time, yeah
I'm gonna make it out this time, yeah
I'm gonna roll the dice
And take a risk tonight
Gotta make it out this time
Have you ever felt alone like the whole world was missing
And when you prayed it seemed like no one was listening
You try to keep the faith and keep on living
But when you struggling the future looks distant
All your hope seem to be just pipe dreams
And you really gotta wonder what your life means
That's when you gotta pick yourself up out the dust
Make a change and find a place in your heart you trust
You ain't always gotta take the first card your dealt
In this life only you can represent yourself
Never let your circumstances hold you back
You were born free, never gotta feel trapped
And on the pursuit to happiness you're gonna feel pain
But the only way to win is to stay in the game
The naysayers they're gonna try and embarrass you
But I've learned that the struggle builds character

See y'all don't understand us you know
Ruff Ryders is a family
Ruff Ryders, Ruff Ryders, Ruff Ryders
Lets go, Swizz Beatz
This is the darkest shit, sparking shit
Hittin' with the hardest shit, 'cause before we started shit
With kids I knew my fuckin' friends all turned against me
Said fuck it, bought me a dog ever since me
And my dog has been like this, he got my back I got his
Schemin' on mad niggas, that's how we do bidz
It's about time to start another, robbin' spree
'Cause yo, my way is highway, robbery, chump
When I was up North in, sing-sing, I was sendin' niggas home in a coffin
Livin' like a orphan
You bad, nigga? I'll be back (Let's) see if you'll be still here
You know my style, I'll put yo' fucking man in a wheelchair
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me
That's how I left him G, scared to death of me
Niggas cannot run, hit with the hot one
From the shotgun, casket close, wonder how he got done
Yo yo, E-V-E, my dogs believe in me
Petty thugs hide yo' cake, never teasin' me
I show love to, all my bitches hustlin' ones
Tussle with thieves, makin' moves, second to none
I locked it, uh, made a sudden move you got bit
Flooded wit the double R, real street shit
Da blond hair bandit, you got guns, hand it
Turn my face when I bust a cannon
'Cause I don't wear sunblock, ask Drag if the fire is hot (Flame on, baby)
Shit pop shells, fall three feet, roll over and stop
We warn niggas that we coming then we total the block
We scorn niggas like their mothers then we wet up their socks
Red dye, escaping on the red-eye, to seashore
Then hide out and buy out bars 'til we see fall
In this game, we beat y'all, you got money? Keep yours
For eyes be tearin' tryin' to identify the features
And you can come see me if you tryin' to get some grams tonight
'Cause I can get it for you raw, gray, tan or white
Fuck rap yo, I'd rather be plannin' a flight
Somewhere hot on a wave runner, tanning with dykes
Blowin the haze, while all of 'em givin' me brains
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line
But everybody wanna contact me and get wit me
But still end up being mad 'cause I charge fifty
And as for you sucka, you can keep those raps
And screw your awards, my son can't eat those plaques
I never was shit but some things I never forget
Like if you spend three you're guaranteed to make back six
Drove the Benz off the lot and just dusted her off
Tints, rims, stash, ticked the governor off
Even the cats that be hatin' still be lovin' the dogs
'Cause they know that the double R's comin' for war
Wha
If you ain't ready to die, then why should you live?
'Cause when I start bustin' the guns, you hidin' the kids
And the P is still ridin' with clips, survivin' with bricks
We beefin' on the 4th you got to die on the 5th
Like I wasn't hustlin' dope or robbin' the blocks
Starvin' or not, carvin' the cheek, palmin' the Glock
I figure which nigga could I watch with a watch
I like to knock off my crack then I pull off a heist
Put it together, double it twice, this shit is my life
Catch me with a 45, hot pair of Nikes
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or give me your face
Give me a shank, it's Holiday ugh
The hoopties in the front but the truck is a mile away
Niggas wanna ride tomorrow when they prob'ly die today
'Cause the P'll hollow the guns
Holla at sons (I feel you, nigga)
And when they go to holla back
They be swallowin' one
(Uh, uh, uh)
Y'all dem bust in them crowd niggas and hit whoever
When you should aim for them niggas that took yo' leather
They right there, but you scared that they gon' bust
'Cause they crazy, but crazy niggas bleed like us
See I'm one shot through the heart like Cupid
Y'all niggas might be crazy, but y'all not stupid
It's '99, I'm killings you women and kids
Fuck Scarface! Watch me, I'm more action to see
Than them motherfuckers that y'all see on T.V
And fuck what you heard this how Sheek get down
Comes to guns? Shit I'm rhyming with one on me now
You never know what clown goin' walk into the studio
Talking shit and it's gonna be more than the amps that blow
I pour gas on your skin and watch your shit detach
With a book of matches now that's when you have met your match
And the worst thing for you is to have a gun when I'm thirsty
I turn niggas more holy man, than Eddie Murphy
And I deal with more bricks than that city do in jersey
Y'all got call cops niggas, I got autops niggas, that'll bust you and slide
And some ol' 6-drop niggas
Revolver Pop niggas, Eezox niggas
Get knocked, say I smoke detox niggas
Drug program, hit the streets and cop 56 mo grams
Y'all niggas ain't fuckin' with the fam
And that's word
(Come on, come on, come on,)
Boy, what's the difference between fire and water?
You'd rather drown or die of torture, 'cause your skins of ya
And watch ya burn off fat, dog, I'm off the thermostat
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo' bitch a perm with that
Keep shells in the envelopes 'cause I'll mail out bullets
More blood than a riot on a jailhouse footage
Buck 40, 'bout a extra 20 wit the semi
When it hit you, you gon' do a 360 pretty swiftly
When I burn you to a crisp, you gon' be crunchier than chips
With mah hand all up in da bag munchin' on tha shit
Bit by bit, clip by clip and every block by block
Is brick on brick I got knots on knots
'Cause I got things that'll pop yo top

Just let me talk to you for a second, baby, please
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
Uh, how should I start it off? You must have thought me soft
Like it was all good to move on and cross me off
We never shared secrets, we wasn't fuckin' raw
Helped you when you were down and now you got the fuckin' gall
We used to be so tight, we was each other's life
You was my husband and no doubt I was your fuckin' wife
Did anything you ever asked of Eve
You turned out to be a devil, nigga, I couldn't believe
Sneakin' numbers out my phone, callin' bitches on the cell
What the hell? Clunky bitches, one on the scale
I'm like a dime over line, you can't calculate my status
And you fuckin' with these bitches like my ass wasn't the fattest
Like I didn't dress the baddest any time we surface
Must have been insecure, niggas made you nervous
And I guess it was your purpose to lock me in
But you fucked up, your luck's out, but then again
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
Used to let shit slide, caught a couple lies
I chilled for real, I mean, I called a couple guys
Knew when you was fuckin' up, I saw it in your eyes
And I guess it was my fault 'cause I put up the disguise
In public, we was happy, in home, we'd be scrappin'
Later, we'd be naked, jokin', smokin', and laughin'
Makin' up to break up, I thought that shit was love
But it wasn't and I learned the hard way soakin' in suds
Cryin' all depressed, not again, you'll never catch me
Wishin' on a star for some nigga to come bless me
I tried to save it, all you ever did was stress me
Pushin' all my buttons, why the fuck must you stress me?
Nigga, get a life, go on and find a wife
Get the fuck out my face 'fore I go and find a knife
And you still callin' my phone tryna act polite, huh
Askin' me for favors, now, you know that shit ain't right, but
You had me, you lost me

Uh-oh, you see me comin', don't you? Look at you runnin', won't you?
Oh, you gon' sit there and see me like I wan' approach you
Now it's payback, I'm talkin' way back
To bitches callin', hangin' up, you ain't no way to save that
To unanswered questions, home in the a.m.
To you out clubbin', forcin' me to stay in
Remember, okay then, it's over, no playin'
I said it before, I'm 'bout to do it, fuck what you sayin'
Too late for apologies, go puff on a pile of weed
Think about this good bitch that's leavin' and don't follow me
Movin' on, shut you down, now you wanna regret
You could fuck all day, but it'd never feel like my sex
Played yourself, tried to show I cared, you ain't care
When I needed you the most, nigga, you wasn't there
And the game is the same, comes around, goes around now
Hate me forever while the chorus goes around, huh
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh (I want you back)

He said he got played

You can't get out yo mind
You go to sleep

She said I let him go and play
But he always come back
I said that can't be true
She said it always is

P-A period, Eve, they hearin' it
Believe they fearin' it, but lovin' it, though
I hate the game, fuck the fame, but I'm lovin' the dough
You couldn't tell me in a million years
And a thousands bars that I'd roam the reservoir with dogs
Show the world what crew love was about
Drop ""Adrenaline!"", ""4-5-6"", I showed 'em what a thug was about
I know you love flossin' with X, bustin' them checks
Getting tattoos, paw prints on your chest
I ain't mad, baby, get that cash
Make them hatin' bitches kiss your ass, Ruff Ryde, lift that strap
I'm gon' walk 'til I see how these fleas gon' feel
When I come through with the whip with the Bs on the wheel
Burgundy thing, cream gut, cherry wood
Steerin' wheel, a B surrounded by the wing on the hood
I know they like, ""How they collide?""
He roll with Roc, you Ruff Ryde, but we Black Friday tied
How you think they gon' feel seein' us Grammy night?
Let me tell you, a bunch of ifs, ands and mights
Billboard charts, Source ads and mics

We gon' hold it down for Illadel' for life
Came through, made a name, nigga, nailed it tight
And now we shine, been knew, shit it was 'bout time
Switched from streets to beats, Platinum lines
Used to struggle in the hood just to brodie the mic
Took the fame 'cause they ain't give it us, now we excite
The biggest crowds and they screamin' loud, Philly the shit
Roc-A-Fella rap guerrilla, blonde bombshell bitch
I Ruff Ryde, take your mind, shit, you doin' the same
Work hard, now the streets stay shoutin' our names
Fame is funny, get money, snakes in the grass
When the hostility shows, niggas face get smashed
But I stay grounded, brick house stallion
My bitches keep me real while I make millions
Pile it on, huh, we gon' have it all in a minute
Give it back the hood and we gon' ball in a minute
'Cause anything we want, we gon' have on our plate
Matter of time before we killed it, Beans, it was our fate
And cats is stressed, gave it all, they expected less
Disrespect, take it back the hood, protect your chest

Now that's the hottest thing in the streets, our beats is Swizz
Cheesed up with holes in the shit, Double R roll thick
And ain't nothin' sweet but Drag-Eve tracks honey roasted
Burn it 'til it's been around now, how the fuck that sound?
Yo, let's talk about
Platinum plaques, hangin' on my wall

Heard 'em say it, see me celebrated
I pop shit when it's necessary, not for nothin'
I use clips for them big beefs
See me bustin'? Blaow!

I'm far from a clown

Lyin' on yourself, you ain't ready for the world, mama
Beggin' every second money hungry, life drama
Get your own stacks
Why you think these niggas pussy hungry?
'Cause you actin' triflin'
Layin' up, takin' his money, uh
I wanna talk about live or die, fuckin' with I
Niggas will fry like stripped bacon
I leave them shakin', keep 'em sizzlin'
Fuckin' with them, you might win
But they only got six shots with a barrel that spin
And us, our clip is spinnin'
And hittin' all their men
Yo, I wanna talk about ride or die
My dogs control confrontation in any situation

Trunk full of funk, nigga while I'm breaking bread
Sliding through your system, banging, bobbing heads
Doin' mines and I don't care what other niggas saying
They can pop it, but they can't stop it, boy I'm gettin' mine
Selling clothes up in this bitch like Calvin Klein
Getting cuties to shake they booty at the same time
I'd be damned If I go back to jail for the same crime
I'm too slick to get caught up in this dirty game
I'm a scholar that make dollas off the birdy game
Crip hoppin' I got it popping on the boulevard
Man, I ain't fucking with Chevys, I got my own car

Living life is so hard

Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to touch my heart so He can ease the pain
Anything to hide the scars (Uh, uh)
Thank you God, I appreciate every blessin'
Happiness to heartaches, take it as a lesson
I learned a lot in this year
Got a profession that keeps me stressin'
Facin' criticism, answerin' questions
And you still keep me happy and healthy
Blessed with a mind to play the cards that life has dealt me
No doubt I struggle
I cry at times, sometimes I wish I could live in a bubble
And it gets hard not to stray to trouble
I'm proud of me, got a family that holds me down
Real friends 'cause the other ones claim they don't know me now
But long as God with me, I'ma be good for sure
He's the one who picks me up when my face is to the floor
Life is crazy, people never cease to amaze me
Stay with stories 'bout how they made me or raised me
And it's funny 'cause everybody seems to be so hungry
Either they want my life or they want my money
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to send me light so I can touch my soul

Living life is so hard

How life be so hard? (How can my life be so hard?)
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong (Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong)
Every day I pray to God (Every day I pray)
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong (Whatever, whatever, whatever, uh)
Been through a lot, still gotta watch my back 'cause people plot
Closest'll do you dirty just to take away your spot
Some days I feel like I wanna quit
But I prayed too long and dreamed and worked too hard for it
Wouldn't trade my life, none, even a little bit
'Cause it could be worse for real, I could be turnin' tricks
Might bitch and whine, but always just in the back of my mind
I could be livin' on the streets, nothin' to eat without a dime
So I thank God, and I think why, 'cause life's hard
Meet a lot of people, but always I'm puttin' up my guard
'Cause you never know, some people snakes
Some people give a lot, but mostly not, most people take
A lot of smilin', claimin' realness, but most people fake
Still gotta smile, 'cause that's what it takes
Sometimes it's lonely, I feel like people see me, really don't know me
But my best friend is Him and I know He'll hold me
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to send me light so I can touch my soul
And always know right from wrong
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to touch my heart so He can ease the pain
Anything to hide the scars (Uh, uh)
I got a lotta people on my side protectin' me
Dee, Waah, Chivon, and the family
Gotta thank God for them 'cause they keep me right
I also thank Him every day for the love of my life
I thank Him for this gift just to be able to write
And rock crowds that scream my name, able to excite
Thank God for my fans, I love the way they love me
Happy that I'm comfortable, eatin', livin' lovely
I love my life, still there's the pressure and pain
So I make sure that I'm grounded and able to maintain
A lotta people think I'm lucky, travelin' and hangin' out
But if they only knew, I wish I could be hangin' out
I'm bangin' out hits in the studio, I'm livin' low

For the love of the money, so I could cop everything
From icy rings to drop-tops and now I'm on top
But to look back on my reality, happy I stopped
Lettin' niggas ruin my world
Impressed by niggas tryna school this baby girl, I was fuckin' too early
Fifteen, knowin' money was green, puffin' too early
Body big, not grown, knowledge duckin' too early
Thought it was cute to flirt with older cats up in they face
Didn't have a daddy, so I put a daddy in his space
My mommy was my shelter, but I broke free
Learnin' that the streets was harder than I thought they'd be
Wantin' to be grown, rebellin'
Ain't no tellin' what I'd be, pussy sellin'? Huh, never would I

Thought I had to to be grown, beginning of my life, but

Heaven only knows

Explode by myself alone, no one helpin'
What am I to do but cry alone at night?
No one in the house, nude TV was my life
Who was I to tell and what would they think of me?
No one understood the pain that was sent to me
Broke down from the things men would say to me
Sellin' dreams to a naive kid, I blame me
But I really never had someone tell me what to do
Teach me that I'm better than just pussy, that's true
Teach me that the future was written, already waitin'
To respect myself in life, not to be consumed with hatin'
Do positive and positive will happen
Stay positive and positive was rappin'

Now I'm twenty years old and look where I'm at
I thank Allah every night and pray there's no turning back
I wanna keep my family happy and that's that
Seen tears in my mother's eyes from platinum plaques
See, things I've done, I don't regret, I just learn
From mistakes in the past, knowing now I had to earn
Respect and earn trust, survivin' school was never given
The way you find out what life's about is simply livin'
To be strong, stay strong, let nobody crush you
Your body is your temple, young girls, don't let him touch you
He'll respect anything you say if he really loves you
Don't settle for second, let him put no one above you
I did a lot of things in my life I take back
Gotta take from the good and the bad, collect that
'Cause it help the bill, who you see now, respect that
Young, Black, and strong, keep me in your tape deck, but

Cause we ain't got nuttin to do none of the choices you be choosin
It's the eve of destruction, tracks I be fuckin
Cats be fascinated by the styles I be bustin
Got you niggas open, got you niggas lustin
Knockin emcees on they backs causin lyrical concussions

I'm tired of talkin' to this answering machine shit
I seen you earlier
But you know you was with them Ruff Ryder niggas
I ain't really fuckin' with it like that shit
Yo, yo nigga, if you shy, move on
Only room for a thug that can hold on
Keep me right in the night, early in the morn'
I need a dog that can bite it if the pressure's on
Damn, I hate it when I find out that you niggas soft
Go run and hide for cover when the trouble starts
I like it when he stay and play his part
Ain't scared to put a slug through a nigga's heart
Takes the best of both worlds, don't discriminate
East Coast, West Coast, I don't playa hate
Platinum Daytan on the 6-4, regulator
Big trucks in the hood, black Navigator
If you icy with the price, bring me that ring pa
Might entice me to play nicely, come and get'cha
You got a wifey, tell her nicely I'm in the picture
'Cause I ain't gon' struggle for long and try to get'cha
Come on Eve, why you talkin' crazy and all stuck up?
Why you stay tryna play me like yo' ass is tough, what?
My own fuckin' money ain't good enough
You got a nigga so sick, I'm 'bout to throw the fuck up
But I love ya (Come on, ma)

How can I live with you? Icy huh?
Me standin' next to you bare, I heard your pockets knotted
But me, I'm schemin' on the cottage
And you a nigga to turn his back on a bitch
Like I ain't got it and forget that
Bratty type spoiled by the best black
Caddy escalated, '99 edition, get that
And what you ain't equal to a shwang and I ain't with that
Not impressed by all of this is mine but we can split that
Give me all of it, homebody, this ain't no Kit-Kat
Start me off with time, couple weeks and I could flip that
What's this 50/50? You ain't breakin' off none
Ya stash is limited, I see it insufficient funds
Mad 'cause I don't speak but why should you disrespect?
So until ya pockets swells speak to the back of my neck

Yo, yo blonde hair must be an aphrodisiac for cats
Want me, dicks be harder than aluminum bats
Flaunt me, I don't hang around with average cats
With average whips, that spend average stacks
I'm into anythin' but normal things
Celly rings from tha broker at the stock exchange, I'm hearin' that
Glacier-filled chains all the haters starin' at me
Make sure I stay nice and keep ya bitches glarin' at
Wave ya Rollies in the air, yeah, last year
Now I'm searchin' for the platinum iced out Cartier
Laid up in da cuts in silk Dolce underwear
Yeah, baby, spend that, that's all I'm tryna hear
It's funny how I used to want the richest niggas
Keep five on deck to see who get the quickest figures
'Cause I only want the pick of the litter for this one

Shit
You, me, and she
What we gonna do, baby?
Baby?
Yo, shit
I did it to myself, couldn't help the way I felt about him
Sick when he wasn't there, like I never dealt without him
Played the fool by choice, all I had was this man
Let him have the best of both worlds 'cause it was his plan
All the things I wanted to hear, he told me gently
Whatever it was, wanted nothin', gave me plenty
Told me that he split with this chick, but couldn't shake her
'Cause she had his kid, so he fed her with his paper
First it started off like that, dough for closure
Started slackin' off, in fact, it wasn't over
Now my world is crumblin' down, I'm feelin' shaky
Used to bein' Superwoman, no bitch could replace me
Wanted him to leave me alone, but I was caught up
Thought I was strong, broke down when breakin' up was brought up
Tried to really ride with this dude, I thought I loved him
And every time I'd ask what I should do, he said trust him

Attitudes and tryna hold out, that shit was useless
The more I tried to back up, the more he kept comin'
Lie after lie, shit, lyin' wasn't nothin'
Tear after tear come down, tellin' me be cool
All I need is you, baby, nobody could be you
Believed him, he deceived me just to keep me
Callin' me from her spot, sayin' how he need me

If he is real or a liar put the plier to his nuts
Or the fire to his guts
'Cause niggas is too soft
That heat make niggas cool off
Fuck ice, I'm tryna cop the crew lofts
So we can be back in effect
I throw the barrel to the back of your neck
And hop back in the 'vette

They say rap is like dust and we the only ones sellin' the juice

So scared, they don't even come around in places that I show up

Me against who? Nigga, grow up
Bitches choke, can't even get their flow up
I ain't got no fear 'bout you bitches in the industry
Actin' all confused, don't know who you supposed to be
Chickens lost, steady worryin' 'bout who's dick is tossed
Stop stallin', better get this thing before it's gone
But I ain't mad 'cause I ain't gon' pass it on
Callin' askin' can you get on my shit 'cause your cash is gone
You won't get no sales off of me, bitch please

I'm tryna find out what you all about (Yeah)
Baby girl I wanna get in ya head (My head?)
Damn is you everything that you said? (No Doubt)
Mean no harm. I admire ya style (Hmm)
Just take a second baby here me out
I know ya game you tryna make me shout
Yo look I'm just tryna figure you out
He approached me boldly. Said he felt me said I'm lookin lonely
I had to stop 'em. Tell him daddy chill cause you don't know me
He said listen ma mean no harm
Just wanna let you know my story yo, don't be alarmed
Usually I'm like the bitchy type
I'm quick to hit 'em wit a 'Ha yeah, ok aight'
'What's ya name again?'
But I was feelin dude
And to my surprise for once I wasn't being rude
Had these eyes that'll make you melt
So what its corny. That's the way I felt
Had this body not a big deal but it helped
I mean this nigga had some shit wit 'em
And everytime I tried to talk
He grabbed my hand and said sweetheart just listen
Chorus
Felt like I was little. Got me back to shy days
Is he being real or is he comin at me sideways?
Said he want a build wit me. I'm like here we go
Said he was a regular nigga that liked my flow
Confidence is key wit me so I let him go on
Casanova sayin shit like damn you got a glow on
I'm like he did his homework knowin what I like
Can't find nothin wrong on 'em and he might be my type
Continued wit his story bout his 3 years in jail
How he missed the streets cause being in there was like hell
Bout his little daughter Kira center of his world
His princess and she know she daddy's little girl
I'm lookin at his face-I looked at my watch
He smiled said he wished that time would stop
I apologized to 'em cause I didn't mean to be rude
He said 'I know you busy. Just really wanted to meet you.'
Chorus
Asked me if I had a man I said that I didn't
Wanted to know if he could be that wit my permission
Told 'em that I wasn't ready. He said 'Yeah right'
Told me that I need a real nigga in my life
I agreed wit 'em. Told him that'll come soon
Let him know that I enjoyed the talk but had to run soon
He asked when's the last time I took time for me?
And if I ever reflected on how shit could be
He told me I was blessed. I said 'Dog I know it'
He said just a reminder. Feel that way and never blow it, huh
Slipped me his number said use it for inspiration
Kissd my cheek and whispered thank you for your conversation, huh

I’m trying to make it through, like you believe me
Ayo, every day it’s a struggle
Waking up, stressed emotions I juggle
As I look around and watch the world crumble
Something tell me, ""Pray and always stay humble""
Yea, what doesn’t kill you only make you stronger
Stay chin up, hold on a little longer
They used to doubt me, and tell me I ain’t have a voice
But then the angel showed me a better choice
Never let the world tell me how I’m defined
I give myself credit, never need a co-sign
Some days I cry but then I think and realize
I’m a star, and damn it, I’ma shine
Show the world all the greatness that I possess
Gotta keep the pushin', keep on makin progress
If a beautiful rose can grow from concrete
Then there’s no reason for man to accept defeat

What’s a day when there’s no Eve

The feeling I had when you said I wouldn’t go far
I knew how to shine, but life kept me in the dark
Dreaming I’m the moon, ‘cause the world’s too hard
Goals with no plan, running through quicksand
Thought I’d go under, but I’m still breathing
Not afraid of war so I keep fighting
I’m worth a lifetime, no one nice in
So I go back to the lab again, grab me a pad and pen
Write a legacy for my children’s children
Build a world for everybody to live in
And who would me I’d gladly do it again
Wouldn’t believe, now I know that I’m chosen
And everyone that kept it G, I owe them
Treasure my heart, so I always stay golden

And it feel foreign to you, ‘cause you ain’t like that
Never let nobody steal your powers, snatch it right back
You gotta be the person you was born to be
I learned the only person I could control is me
And maybe they will see inside of me eventually
And even is they don’t you got the right to disagree
Now listen, I ain’t got the answers or the plan
Me, I’m trying to figure out, trying to understand
Trying to be the best woman I could be for man-kind
Love is to be shared so I give mine
I’ll go hard, I’ll go hard
And this time I won’t miss
I’ll go hard, I’ll go hard
On top of the world I’ll live
Tell the world for me

We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm thinkin' that you and me, should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm sick of that
Yea it's hard. Breakin' up ain't never easy. Believe me
But fuck that. I wasn't gettin' treated like I needs be
But trust. I was controllin' all the things around me
But shit. I always been this chick ever since you found me
I tried and I tried. Cried and I cried
Down for you nigga wit' lie after lie, after lie
Got sick of tradin' games wit' you
Started bein' jealous of me like dames would do
I'm like dawg check ya balls. Mad 'cause I receive applause
Men in my life was against the law
Startin' fights in public just so you could piss me off
I swear. If I was a dude it'd be fist to jaw
Always mad at my mouth 'cause I cursed you out
Missin' hard. Know you feelin' what these verses 'bout
Doin dumb shit. Breakin' things. Hidin' my phone
I'm outta 'dis here. Pimp jus' leave me alone
Ya love girls, girls. Yea but you lost the best
I had to get away. I'm past the stress
Mama told me baby girl never settle for less
Learn the hard way. Hard days. I'm ready for next
A bunch of leavin'. I don't need Eve's shit. I'm doin' me
Soon as pack you sippin'. With the booze. You and me
Reminiscin' 'bout the way you was pursuin' me
Actin' like your period on screamin' you doin' me
Well bye dawg. Have a nice life I'm fine dawg
Don't try to track me down or call 'cause that line off
Hope you feelin' bad without me. See if you can laugh without me
Cry what tears? I'm happy I'm free
Still ridin' past the spots that you know I go
Procrastinatin' wit' yo niggas hopin' that I show
Never know what you have 'till it's gone (huh)
Wonder what she doin'? Best believe she doin' her (come on)
Funny how it happens when you fall in love
When you find out that the one you wit ain't who you want
Then you move out 'till you find yourself anotha love
But your ex gone always hate 'cause he can't hit you off
You don't hear me though
Claim you wanna please me. Yet you vex me
Can't front. Be thinkin' 'bout the way you used to sex me
God damn. Days short. Nights was long
And I was mad when I started spendin' nights alone
But I'm better off by myself lookin' for somethin' else
Sendin' me shit you can't pronounce. I don't want nuthin' else
Wanted to love you until the end of my time
But fuck it.

35583,Eve,Gotta Man (Clean),"1 ContributorGotta Man (Clean) Lyrics
I got a boyfriend now *laughs*
C'mon, uh, uh, uh, yo, yo
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him (Yeah)
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him (Yeah)
This sexy lookin' like love
No doubt sophisticated thug keep me guessin'
Said it would be a blessin' just to watch you undressin'
Callin' you daddy, late nights I'm layin' on your chest and
Stay reminiscin' 'bout the rest and, and how they less than
Tryna come between what we share, can't compare (Never)
Could have been left, but when it's mine, I never share
Fight to the death if need be to prove that
Wounds from your wars, other chicks couldn't soothe that
Broke from a bad back, I'm holdin' you down
Doin' dirt with other pigeons but them other fishes drown
Locked in, for however long, I'm playin' it smart
Court dates in other cities, there, I'm playin' my part
Wifey, in ya life see forever be us
Passenger side of a Bentley or the number 2 bus
Tell the whole world, papi, Eve don't want nobody else
With other dogs pick and choose, but you, I'm keepin' for myself
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
All my peoples thinkin' I'm delirious, but the love I feel is serious
Couples of the world, no comparing us
Been through fist fights with cats when I see it escalate
I'm the getaway driver, so my baby can escape
Pull my ice for the bail, spending nights in jail
Drawing hearts on the wall with our names around the cell
It may be a little craziness, maybe I'm blind
But for me to leave now, lookin' for love would take a lifetime
So I'm keepin' mine, uh huh keep me blind
Feels like heaven when we makin' love, controllin' my spine
Wine and dine, I don't need that as long as long as you with me
And you chickens thinkin' that you competition, come and get me
My position is held, some try and all fail
So whatever baby, uh-huh, good enough to sell
Never leave his baby girl, mad 'cause he claim me
Only thug in the hood that was wild enough to tame me (C'mon)
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him (Yeah)
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him (Yeah)
I'm the one to leave helped him build his luxuries
Carry stories that can hurt him, still he only trustin' me
Secrets never leave my mouth, even if they torture me
Always taught to hold the ground, that's why I'll always be his queen
Did some dumb things, see him in the party, start to flip
Curse him out on the regular just to make him sick
Disappear for a day or two to test his loyal ground
Keep my dogs on a short leash, controllin' the growl
Open wide, I don't care who knows, I'm swallowing my pride
And he fast to blast a cat that he think be on the prowl
But I'll never let him go, temper flare, let it go
Always be his extra back bone, quick to let you cats know
Always by his side, Eve the apple in his eye
Us together ain't no stopping snatchin' pieces of the pie
Us together in our own world, what's his becomes mine
Exceed eternity with him we'll stand the test of time (Yeah)
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)

I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever

No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever

Some nights, all alone
Thoughts of you come creepin' in
Temporarily insane
'Cause you're never gonna change, no
We had good times with the bad
Always out with what we had
Keep your pride, I'm not mad
Make me feel like loves a fad
I'd always thought
We'd be happily forever
The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Never thought I was the type to hang around
Lied to myself constantly
'Bout the person I thought you would be
Who's to blame? I guess it's me
I cause my own misery
Tit for tat, this and that
I needed my own life back
Now here I am
I'm so happy, it's time to move on
The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
We had, we had, we had, we had (Are you listening?)
We had good times with the bad
Always out with what we had
Keep your pride, I'm not mad
Make me feel like loves a fad
I'd always thought, we'd be happily forever
I'd always thought (What you want her to do?)
Now here I am
I'd always thought (Why can't you listen?)
We'd be happily forever
The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway

35585,Eve,We On That Shit,"Alright now, get your guns, ain't no stoppin' me
Need the whole cash bundle for me and my bitches' shoppin' spree
A robbery? Damn, you smart, and you guessed right of me
Askin' all those questions was to set you up right
Wet 'em all, pretend I'm Jada, let us set it off
Cartier, Rollie, time frozen, get 'em off
Danglin' medallions, all that glistens is mine
And all that bitchin' that you doin', I'll have you kissin' this 9
Y'all niggas worse than bitches, tears in your eyes
I ain't got no sympathy, so if you scared, nigga, cry
On your knees, face, then chest, lips shut
Fuck the mask, we robbin' y'all in lipstick and wigs, what?
Yeah, we raw, but you took me out and let me see it all
Braggin' 'bout the shit you got and now I get it all
Matter of fact, take your clothes off, like it when they bare
Everything from Iceberg to silk Dolce underwear, it's mine
Ayo, check that nigga 'cause we on that shit
Get out your ride, fool, 'cause we on that shit
Hit your stashbox 'cause we on that shit
Run that ice 'cause we on that shit
Keep a loaded clip 'cause we on that shit
Ride or die, nigga, 'cause we on that shit
We out to get it all 'cause we on that shit
And Eve don't play 'cause she takes no shit
I shoot backin' out, P maxed 'em out
And only way I don't get shit is if you stash the house
Professional bitches, destined for riches and precious jewels
Distracted by the size of my ass, had you fooled
I ain't gettin' nada, forget that
Just sit back and watch me take everything, even your dro sack
Yeah, my bitch can roll it, smoke it while we pack
And expensive paintings on your walls, give me that
Ain't no slackin', time ain't a factor, I'ma get it all
Used to ball with your niggas, now I'm makin' you crawl
Across the floor, ego crushed and I don't give a fuck
Small change to the Range, heard what I said? Give it up
I know it ain't right, but me and my bitches gotta eat tonight
And every night from now on, get it right
Why? Why ask why? I'm simply livin'
And I get what I want by simply takin' or you simply givin'
Ayo, check that nigga 'cause we on that shit
Get out your ride, fool, 'cause we on that shit
Hit your stashbox 'cause we on that shit
Run that ice 'cause we on that shit
Keep a loaded clip 'cause we on that shit
Ride or die, nigga, 'cause we on that shit
We out to get it all 'cause we on that shit
And Eve don't play 'cause she takes no shit
Y'all niggas faggotish
Cops spot me, got me runnin' out my kicks
Unlatch the ice pieces on my neck and wrist
Screechin' in the street, from the 5 Series to a ditch
I'm fast, heat at the waist and I ain't scared to blast
Duckin', jumpin' over shit, bet this bitch could last
Ready for war, act like I ain't did this shit before?
Practice for me, next week, I'll be wantin' more
Best believe you ain't gon' live to see tomorrow
My dogs already warned your mother she'll be full of sorrow
Bustin' through the door of somebody's house, kids screamin'
I ain't gon' front, somehow, I wish that I was sleepin', dreamin'
Too late, it's done now, all you hear is gun sounds
Cock back, pop, pop, pop, and I'm like what now?
Ghetto bird on me, weavin' through the trees
Last fence I hopped over, fell and landed on my knees
Barrels at my temple, fuck it, I'ma make it simple
Ayo, check that nigga 'cause we on that shit
Get out your ride, fool, 'cause we on that shit
Hit your stashbox 'cause we on that shit

Nothing mediocre, tings always proper
Something like the kush, burned it up, they forgot
I got the game on smash and I'm up with the hammer
Have 'em all flabergasted, leaving with a ?
Out of this world, like deal in the party
All up in the ears, I'm dropping this knowledge
My buzz stay strong, your buzz never started
My albums are the shit, your career never farted
You thought I left, I wasn't gone, I'm just back again
I was overseas making them millions
From Belgium to Brickston, over to Japan
International paper, getting paid again
It's crunch time, my time, baby, I'ma get it
Heat it up, stir the pot, throw some Eve in it
Cook it up, serving fiends just a little bit
Having them addicted, better believe it
Tell them suckers go hard or go home
No surprise, make a claim to the throne
Time's up, kingdom overthrown
Make way, you catch it back to the dome
I can be sweet, got my lyrics steady man
Bodying these hoes, yellow tape at the scene
It is what it is, I'm a lyrical dream

What you gonna do to give me thrills

Go, I’ll show you things you never saw

Can be like an animal, really can you handle, though

You ain’t ready for this boy, you know you scared
It takes a lot to make the sexy kitty purr
No cheap thrills over here, fuck what you heard
Have you geekin' like Screech, nerd
Rude boy, why you sweatin' me
You can’t even handle me
Man you need to stop
Can’t you see I’m outta your league
To impress me you gotta have caliber
Put some precision in your swing, Excalibur
I done gone pro, you still a amateur
You could test it out, but boy you’ll damage her

She tell me that I’m the hottest
I said correction, the coldest
I be in it all night, she wake up makin' mimosas
Gotta her caught in the feelings, textin' and Twitter mentions

Can't trust their stories, tears swellin' in my eyes

Sometimes I feel trapped, got me locked in the cage
But I break free, won't ever let the anger overtake me
'Cause actions of another never make me or break me (Yeah)
I never let 'em shake me
And no matter what, I always wish success to those who hate me
The ones they call my enemies
Who only really wanna be friends of me

And if I didn't make it here, my life would be a mess
Can't live a life of fear
All that get you is nowhere, surrounded by a bunch of stress
And I always had a hard head
Had a choice to play around with life or listen to what God said
So I straightened up, I'm doin' right
Growin' every year, ayo, this thing ain't happen overnight
But I still got a lot to do
Ain't never givin' up 'cause anything I feel I know is possible
Don't never let people discourage

She got a couple things to say to y'all (Okay)
Eve (Uh, uh)
Now I ain't never been the type to not excite you
Can't miss the vixen, admit you like her
Play your position, just might invite you
Party to the morning if she like you
I ain't attracted to no lame dudes, don't wanna name a few
Don't lie either, so do don't ask, she might be namin' you
When I'm allergic to these corny bitches
Tryna start shit to end my freeze, I'm too up on my riches
Game been a part of me, dog, and I'ma keep winnin'
Never should've started me off, I love the way I'm livin'
And they wonder why she won't stop
Sit around monitorin' my sales, hopin' that my shit flop
Now that's the shit I like to laugh at
Obsessed with my every move, dummy, find a crash test
Every year, I'm just a little wiser
And, yeah, it's still room left in the race, go 'head, pull up behind her
Yo, she got 'em like E
Every day eatin' and takin' it to the V
Vixen, V-12 with systems, E
Everybody keepin' it movin'
It's double R, goin' hard, this is Eve-olution
Now scream E
If you're really ready, we're takin' it to the V
Vicious, spit flows ridiculous, E
Say it like you know the letters
Bombshell and it grows a fetish
Just scream my name for me
I'ma hustle 'til I'm stacked up
Lot more to do, when it's cool, then I'ma pack up
Pass the torch along to someone else
But right now, I hold it down, little selfish, thinkin' of myself
Took a long time to make it here
Before I make a move, I make a plan just so I can be prepared
Ain't no turnin' back, it's heavy now, fuck the petty shit
Bigger better shit and I'm ready now, huh
Yo, she got 'em like E

Say it like you know the letters
Bombshell and it grows a fetish
Just scream my name for me
Okay, she talk a lot of shit, cocky, got plenty lip
Promised myself that I'd never live penniless
Took a couple trips, hopped in and out of plenty whips
Stepped up the game, now she readin' plenty scripts
Yeah, I'm accustomed to the good life
But don't get it fucked up, I owe it all to the hood life
Congratulate her when you see her pass
It's a shame how these chicks get agitated when we cross paths
But we ain't even on the same level
I'm thinkin' 'bout a sexy yacht, baby girl, you still on icy bezels
Felt right, had to have it
Third joint still goin' strong, I'm not braggin'
I guess I am a little bit, though, makin' it happen
Who'd have thought I'd be famous one day makin' it rappin'?
Philly, she done lost her mind

Change it up, yah mean? Gotta stay that bitch
How you feel when you hear this? Wasn't prepared, boy
I need the listeners on the dance floor, go 'head, boy

Is you with me or are you bullshittin'? I need to know
Messin' with my concentration, with me, you gotta go
I know you ready to shout it out, yo, this chick incredible
And it's more to come from baby girl, that's if you ready, though
I got a lot, slow down now, I'm losin' my breath

Formula cold-blooded, and I don’t give a shit

Straight killing em, boss bitch stunting

Drive away
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate
Some days I be wanting to get away from it all
To be real this game ain't all it seem to y'all
I mean I'm blessed by my good God
Haaa, that's no question
And I know my journey long
Just a life learned lesson
But the world just a mess right now, going crazy
Thankful for my single mother
Strong how she raised me
Could have gave up long time
And been lazy
But my dream strong
Hear this song I'm not complaining
Just the realization living in this world is draining
I mean I cry real tears and I got real fears
Wanna marriage and some babies
Do y'all hear me in your ears?
Discouraging, keep your courage and walk your path
Question everyday how much longer will we last?
How can you apologize for mankind?
No heart, so soul got sight, but you're the man blind
Not really seeing what he doing to the future
He lost
Love, hate, pain all the same
Still took for granted
Need a reason that's to blame
Gone cause he loved her
Gone cause she hated him
Flipped out taken out from the pain
Who she datin him?
Its like we don't have no meaning
What we breathing for?
Birth child raised right gone now fighting for the war
Damn, enough to make you crawl up in a shell
Cry for the innocent babies in this Hell
Stuck from a fast fuck no shelter from the cold
Drugs and disease never growing to be old
Do you feel me?
Am I seeing all this by myself?
Can't trust the air I breathe
Im praying for my health
Wanna get away but
Where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm making songs let it flow
I said I wanna get away but
Where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm making songs let it flow
Sometimes my heart hurt
Wish I could take away the pain with music
But it won't work
I guess I'm just an optimist
What's it gonna take for all of us to stand up
Put a stop to this?
Man, we in this thing together
Live and breathe together
Everybody love life
But never make it better
Everybody talk shit
But never get together
Shit, I ain't trying to preach
I ain't even teaching
There's some shit bottled up inside me
Im just speaking
Wanna get away but
Where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm making songs let it flow

(Mmm, mmmm)
See y'all don't understand us you know
Ruff Ryders is a family
Ruff Ryders, Ruff Ryders, Ruff Ryders
Lets go, Swizz Beatz
This is the darkest sh, sparking sh
Hittin' with the hardest sh, 'cause before we started sh
With kids I knew my fn' friends all turned against me
Said f it, bought me a dog ever since me
And my dog has been like this, he got my back I got his
Schemin' on mad n's, that's how we do bidz
It's about time to start another, robbin' spree
'Cause yo, my way is highway, robbery, chump
When I was up North in, sing-sing, I was sendin' ns home in a coffin
Livin' like a orphan
You bad, n? I'll be back (Let's) see if you'll be still here
You know my style, I'll put yo' f'ing man in a wheelchair
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me
That's how I left him G, scared to death of me
N's cannot run, hit with the hot one
From the shotgun, casket close, wonder how he got done
Yo yo, E-V-E, my dogs believe in me
Petty thugs hide yo' cake, never teasin' me
I show love to, all my girls hustlin' ones
Tussle with thieves, makin' moves, second to none
I locked it, uh, made a sudden move you got bit
Flooded wit the double R, real street sh
Da blond hair bandit, you got guns, hand it
Turn my face when I bust a cannon
'Cause I don't wear sunblock, ask Drag if the fire is hot
Click pop shells, fall three feet, roll over and stop
Believe in this game, we beat y'all, you got money? Keep yours
For eyes be tearin' tryin' to identify the features
And you can come see me if you tryin' make a gram tonight
'Cause I can get it for you dog, gray, tan or white
I hate rap yo, I'd rather be plannin' a flight
Somewhere hot on a wave runner, tanning with dykes
Blowin the haze, while all of 'em givin' me brains
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line
And as for you playboy, you can keep those raps
And keep your awards, my son can't eat those plaques
Drove the Benz off the lot and just dusted her off
Tints, rims, stash, ticked the governor off
Even the cats that be hatin' still be lovin' the dogs
'Cause they know that the double R's comin' for war
Wha
If you ain't ready to die, then why should you live?
'Cause when I start swinging them things, you hidin' the kids
And the P is still ridin' on trips, survivin' the strip
Beefin' on the 4th you got to fly on the 5th
Like I wasn't hustlin' hope or runnin' the block
Starvin' or not, carvin' the cheek, palmin' the Glock
Figure which playa could I watch with a watch
I like to knock off my work then I pull off a heist
Put it together, double it twice, ridin' for life
Catch me with a 45, hot pair of Nikes
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or give me your face
Give me a shank, it's Holiday ugh
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Y'all dem bust in them crowd cats and hit whoever
When you should aim for them cats that took yo' leather
They right there, but you scared that they gon' bust
'Cause they crazy, but crazy ones bleed like us
See I'm one shot through the heart like Cupid
Y'all dogs might be crazy, but y'all not stupid
Y'all got call cops squealers, I got autops killers, that'll bust you and slide
And some ol' 6-drop killers
Revolver Pop killers, Eezox killers
Get knocked, say I smoke detox killers
Drug program, hit the streets and cop 56 mo grams
Y'all cats ain't mess this fam
And that's word
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Boy, what's the difference between fire and water?
You'd rather drown or die of torture, 'cause your skins of ya
And watch ya burn off fat, dog, I'm off the thermostat
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo' chick a perm with that
Keep shells in the envelopes 'cause I'll mail out bullets
More blood than a riot on a jailhouse footage
Buck 40, 'bout a extra 20 wit the semi
When it hit you, you gon' do a 360 pretty swiftly
'Cause I got things that'll pop yo top
And double R spot yo block with 16 shots and watch y'all drop
And ain't nobody gettin' up, 'less they in the wheelchair

And from the inside I watched it go by
With all that I've got to reach back to remember
The things I fought, so hard with each thought
Then your voice returns until every word burns the walls
I tried to keep you outside, you're part of me now
But you're not around
Why you're under my skin
You found a way to get in
Why you're under my skin
And now the thoughts I resist
I reuse
Strange how it hits me when all of the moments I used to know travel so close
Through my invitation, I'm reluctant to feel it pierce through my skin
And with every inch it brings back the hurt
As thoughts recur inside my head of all that we said
To leave it behind but now you're inside
Why you're under my skin
You found a way to get in

It's about that time, y'all

Eve (The best mix)
Yo, yo, yo
They wanna know
Who's that girl? (Uh, yo, yo, c'mon, c'mon)
Eve's that girl (Uh, yo, yo, yo, uh, c'mon, c'mon)
Who's that girl? (Uh, what's my name, yo? Yo, uh, what's my name, yo?)
Eve's that girl (Uh, uh, c'mon, c'mon, yo, yo)
Can I turn you on by my word spell?
Look into my eyes, think I want you, can't tell
Me, I keep it sexy, daddy, so I can't fail
Keep it gangster for the cowards, so I give 'em hell
Call me misfit, lips spit a gang of trash
Wrist glist' now 'cause I made a gang of cash
Light glam, still street with the durag
Slang, spit game, change speech, how they do that? Huh
Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up and act out
Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
Ain't changed, game don't run me, I run the game
If I gotta keep it gritty, so be it, I'm supposed to change?
Like simple, dizzy broads ain't fuckin' with my mental
Natural-born hustlin' bitch, check what I been through
Got mine, took it from you, and now you slot mine
Exec to my own shit, dog, I'm ownin' dot-coms
Who's that girl? (C'mon, c'mon)
Eve's that girl (Uh, yo, yo, yo)
Who's that girl? (Huh? Uh, uh)
Eve's that girl (Yo, yo)
I can understand why they scared of Eve
Thought I did it one way, ain't prepared for me, huh
Mad 'cause an image I don't care to be
Realness, real shit, spit reality
Attitude rude, that's the Philly in I
Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life, breath of fresh air
Little boys hang me on they wall, I grow 'em chest hair
Why you listen to other shit? You got the best here
Come on, try your luck, shorty, I got the rest scared
Bet you anything you ain't ready and you get left there
Ain't known for frontin', vouch for my behavior
Same way they get down, I get down for this paper
Sixteen mean from my pen, so you can test her
Still need to know who I am, then cop the record
Take it like a class on me and learn the lesson
Bottom line, my world, my way, any questions?
Who's that girl? (Uh, c'mon, c'mon)
Eve's that girl (C'mon, uh, uh, uh, c'mon, c'mon)
Who's that girl? (Uh, E-V-E, y'all, c'mon, now say my name, y'all)

35613,Trina,Fuck Boy,"Six in the morning, nigga at my door
I'm tryna figure out what he out there for
Last time I seen him he was talking shit
Found out his new girl  can't suck no dick
Hit the intercom I ain't let him in
Pussy nigga lucky I ain't fuck his friends
Prolly thought at bitch, Would be down and out
Till he seen my riding round in that chromed out Benz
South Beach nigga you ain't bout that life
You cross that bridge they taking all the ice
You don't want no problems with them boys from the bottom
Strip your ass butt naked and hit the turn pike
You's a fuck boy, fuck boy
My bitch been said it
That's why I should've let your best friend get it
We went on trips you bought Chanel
But money ain't shit when you soft as hell
Cause you's a fuck boy, fuck boy
My momma even said it
Got a new nigga I ain't even gotta sweat it
You still gon talk and that's a got damn shame
But a hoe gon be a hoe and a lame gon be a lame FUCK BOY
You never heard me asking niggas for shit
You be on the gram asking niggas for pics
Can't believe I let you waste all my time
Now this fuck boy on my voicemail crying
Running round town with your bum ass hoe
But I'm the blueprint that's why you at my door
She my number one fan that's what makes it sweet
Bitch'll do anything for a fucking retweet
South Beach nigga you ain't bout that life
You cross that bridge they taking all that ice
You don't want no problems with the boys from the bottom
Strip your ass butt naked and hit the turn pike
You's a fuck boy, fuck boy

Who's bad? Who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's bad?
(Wait, hold up)
Who's bad?
I'm representin' for the bitches
All eyes on your riches
No time for the little dicks
You see the bigger the dick
The bigger the bank, the bigger the Benz
The better the chance to get close to his rich friends
I'm going after the big man
My g-string make his dick stand
Make it quick, then slow head by the night stand
Like lightning, I wanna nigga with a wedding ring
Bank accounts in the Philippines
Blank note to take everything
See I fuck him in the living room
While his children ain't home
I make him eat it while my period on
A little nasty ho, red-bone but a classy ho
Young jazzy ho and don't be scared
If you're curious just ask me hoes
And yes dick sucking comes quite natural
Cause I'm da baddest bitch, what
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
See I hate hoes who take their niggas on talk shows and fought hoes
(Y'all sold, fool)
See if I'm ever crossed or ever caught up in the cross
And if it's your fault ho, I'm going off ho
See I'm unemployed with no boss ho
While y'all sucking dick for free I'm broke off ho
See it pays to be the boss ho
Shit that's how you floss hoes
X-rated elevated, buck naked
And I'd probably fuck your daddy
If your mammie wasn't playa hatin'
Cause I'm da baddest bitch
I'm da baddest bitch, what
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
I got game for young hoes
Don't grow to be a dumb ho, that's a no-no
See if you off the chains
Stay ahead of the game, save up buy a condo
Sell the pussy by the grands
And in months you own a Benz
Another week a set of rims
See if I had the chance to be a virgin again
I'd be fucking by the time I'm ten
See off glass is my motto
Dick suckin' in the auto
Quick fuckin' 'bout to follow
On the back of the truck
Or when I'm dead ass drunk
But I don't get high though
I never took it up the ass
Often tried but I pass
And from what I heard it ain't bad
I'm a curious bitch who took off to get broke off
From the baby's dad
Cause I'm da baddest bitch
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

Ayo, Trina! You ready?
Ayy, Nic'! Let’s get 'em! Yeah
Light the blunt
This is for French Montana, Tory Lanez and friends
J. Harden, and you, too, Mr. Martin
I curved y'all boys (No disrespect to y’all boys)
Yeah, I curved y'all boys (No disrespect to y'all boys)
And to my niggas with bitches that like causin' drama
Me and my bad bitches, we like ""Fuck his baby mama""
He cop me them Chanel bags, them diamonds VVS
You see this 500 million dollar mansion that's wrapped 'round my neck
This is for the ones who happily always toppin' me sloppily
If your money Monopoly, I ain't fuckin’ you properly (No)
He been tryin’ the liquor, taste like a strawberry daiquiri
The interior chicken and the exterior broccoli
When I come through in that Range Rov', the Barbie chain glow
Keep a baddie with me and we curve ’em like a rainbow
Rockin' ice grills like some serious bitches (Let's go)
It's the Barbie and the baddest, Sagittarius bitches
Give me a project bitch
Give me a hood rat chick
One that don’t give a fuck
And say she took that dick
Give me a project chick
Give me a hood rat bitch
One that don't give a fuck
And say she took that dick
I know a dude named Wayne that I used to fuck
I slid on him, got a check, then I was off in that truck
Ferrari photo, hit the gas, left foot on the clutch
Countin' money bags, shit, I been bossin' up
I know this ball player that I been wantin' to fuck
I deal with rich niggas and all of them give it up (Uh-huh)
Project bitches, ass fatter than the rest of them (Yeah)
Bitches so bad, got him cuffin' and arrestin' 'em (Oop)
Yeah, he shoots dice (Okay), his coupes is nice (Uh-huh)
I be playin' with his balls (Why?), 'cause hoops is life (Okay)
Got a New York nigga, Miami nigga
Always yellin' ""gang gang"" with the hammer, nigga
I got a ass eatin' pro (Oh), he's suckin' my toes (Yeah)
Got a bitch bussin' off like calico (Haha)
I got a beggin'-ass dude, want me to ride his face
Got a young side-nigga, gotta hide my face (Rrr)
Give me a project bitch
Give me a hood rat chick
One that don't give a fuck
And say she took that dick
Give me a project chick
Give me a hood rat bitch
One that don't give a fuck
And say she took that dick
It's the two baddest bitches that they love to hate
We racin' yachts, it's a bad bitch holiday
It's Barbie and Cinderella in Gucci and Donatella
I got a young rich nigga with a trap in Alpharetta
I got a couple Haitian niggas who be swipin' them cards
Gettin' that income tax money, takin' trips with Minaj
I know some West Coast niggas wanna bang me out
I show you what a project chick is about, show us the money
Give me a project bitch

Fuck love, what's that?
You fuckin' round, then coming back
No time for games, I've got a plane to catch
I don't want the ring if it ain't meant
I'm tryna make this love thing work
Next minute I'd be thinking you've got a curve
This nigga got nerve, tryna play me for a bird
I don't want this shit, you can keep that purse
You can keep that whip, you can have that bitch
You'll never find another 10-caramel skin with the right tan
I don't fuck with the hype man
So stop hyping shit like it's still the first night, damn
Being being that you hit it, 'bout 100 times
From the room to the kitchen like one more round
When I used to the dishes you was all up in it
Now you wanna act different
You're tryna give a nigga tough love
But shawty know I give enough love
So mama if you keep this up love
Then you gon' have me saying ""fuck love, fuck love""
Fuck love, fuck love, fuck love
Girl you have me saying ""fuck love""
Fuck love, fuck love
Girl you have me saying
Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!
All these rich niggas know me
I was in the benz, so drop drop
A hundred bands on a trophy
Talking 'bout who you want I'm in the new Leron
And this king size is where you belong
And we argued until you was wrong
And I fucked around and tried to lose it all
But I-I showed up right back here
Late night for the night cap here
Take flight for the night back here
Fuck around and get it right back here
No one calling up, no one calling up
Cause you gon' follow us
Cause when you fuck with me
You know what's all enough
You're tryna give a nigga tough love
But shawty know I give enough love
So mama if you keep this up love
Then you gon' have me saying ""fuck love, fuck love""

I throw the deuce up and cop Medusas
I pull the trucks out, I put the coupes up
I don't take no losses, I'm no loser
Big business, is what I'm used to
All she ever wanted was a real one
But that's so hard to find
A big future, she just want to built one
But all she gets is wasted time
Cause she keep falling' for them flaw ass niggas
Cause she keep falling' for them flaw ass niggas
All she ever wanted was a REAL ONE
But that's so hard to find
Even though she's so fine!
I shop myself, I cop myself
For myself, by myself
Got my health, got my wealth
Got my own, don't need no help
Know how to play with the cards I'm dealt
But it would be nice to have a REAL ONE
Picket fences and a lil one
Fly nigga with a bankroll
Educated, but still to know how to kill some
Is that too much to ask?
Do I want too much, too fast?
Do I drive these niggas mad
Soon as they touch the ass?
Can't teach these boys to be men though
Should've learned that from they kinfolk
And I should've known what I was in for
Soon as I gave the fuck nigga my info
All she ever wanted was a real one
But that's so hard to find
A big future, she just want to built one
But all she gets is wasted time
Cause she keep falling' for them flow ass niggas
Cause she keep falling' for them flow ass niggas
All she ever wanted was a REAL ONE
But that's so hard to find
Even though she's so fine
Oh, I hope that situation don't drive you out your mind
And I won't talk about no nigga
I'll only tell you what it would be like if I was, if I was your nigga
Let's let the old shit remain the old shit
Leave it in the past, and we'll remain focus
Say you got an ex, but I ain't even noticed
I ain't trippin' 'bout that nigga or my old bitch
I just know what I be on, got a California King to put your body on
Make a nigga mad when we put on that ass
But the Og got the shady form
All she ever wanted was a real one
But that's so hard to find
A big future, she just want to built one
But all she gets is wasted time
Cause she keep falling' for them flaw ass niggas
Cause she keep falling' for them flaw ass niggas
All she ever wanted was a REAL ONE

Verse: Whats your description? I told you mine I wuz feeling real horny called the party lines
Dude sounded so good I ain't wasting time I'mma take my clothes off and just go for mine
The way that he was talking and describing his self I pictured Reggie Bush I ain't seeing
Nothing else
My eyes closed tight on the living room couch one hand on pussy putting fingers in my
Mouth
Cheating on my man I'm getting my freak on as long as it ain't real I ain't doing nothing
Wrong just a dirty fantasy on the football field
We laying in the grass loving how it feels pulling my hair, bitting my lips, throwing
It back, thristing my hips, throwing champaigne down and he taking sweet sips now we
Bout to climax he just took me on a trip
Chorus:
Verse: The next day I called the party line again I was looking for that voice that's when I
Thug in a thug that sounded like trick to me you should have heard that nasty fantasy
He made me see us in the school house I was the last student left and I was bout to
Walk out he said bend over show him a shot in my private school skirt so aroused to god
Hard as a missile I blew on his whistle role playing back and forth he said I can't dismiss
You asked me if I could kiss you then I got wet
This phone home thing is getting better than sex don't need protection everythings safe
I even let him spank me I came on his...
I know he was so amazed to hear me come on the phone he wasn't playing no games he
Was getting it on
Do you feel me baby sexing your body touching you softly making you horny go head and close your eyes put your hands on your thighs lets fantasy from the other end of the line (2x)

I remember one time I called him your name
I played it off though, but who's to really blame?
We're playing a deck of cards, it's a dirty game

I wish I never met you boy..
If I could turn back time, then I make it so that you were my boo
I wish I never met you boy..
Everytime I'm with my man, all I do is sit and think of you
Don't wanna feel the way I feel about you
Verse 1: Trina
When we first got together I saw us chillin' forever
A lifetime bestfriend for worse or for better
Then you switched up the weather, sunshine to clouds
I found a condom in your dresser and you know how we get down
You fuckin' clown now I wish I never met you
I should've listened to mama, she said you wasn't nothin' special
So now its to the left, to the left...
And everything you own is on the porch, nigga step!
And tell me...

What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Would you make it work or would you wanna choose?
Between the one you love and between the one you hate
Cause thats just how it is...
Chorus: 1x
Verse 2: Trina
Maybe I'm trippin', or I just can't figure you out
One night you say you love me, the next you flippin' out
But you can bounce, you know I don't need a man
I'm sorry I met you I could do bad by my damn self
I can't let you disrespect me, I'mma queen..
And all my real boss chicks know what I mean
I bet you still trickin', you ain't learned your lesson
Now let me check your text messages...hahaa

Calling me names that apply to me
Cumming all inside of me

35640,Trina,What’s Beef?,"What’s Beef? Lyrics
Ayo Drew, turn mah mic up
Cause I want these muthafuckas to hear me
I see you rap bitches talking real slick in the magazines
I'm the same bitch your man want and yo' best friend's a Trina fan
Hahah y'all bitches funny to me
You know what?
I feel like playin'
I'm in the air, I don't hear bitches corny raps
The baddest bitch is back
The baddest bitch is back
What's beef?
Beef is when bitch titties lookin' like they sleep
Beef is when her clothes lookin' like dirty sheets
Beef is when I help you sell the records just like I do, now that's beef
What's beef?
Beef is when these hoes say mah name in the streets
Beef is when they fame only last a few weeks
Beef is when I help you sell the records just like I do, now that's beef
Mah blades been sharp, mah spades been played with this one
But nuh uh, this ain't a game with this one
See, I'mma put some hoes to shame so listen
I done seen a lot of lame but it's a shame that this one
You see the problem is I used to like Khia til you started
Jumpin' on the dick with Trick and doin' all of my leftover shit
Now yous a scam, What's up? You get the leftover hits
Bitch get on the bandwagon or get left over bitch
Can't believe the Baddest Bitch whipped this drunk ass bitch
Her slay titties havin', fake Lauryn Hill ass bitch
Move to Georgia cause in Florida, you wasn't hittin' on shit
Now you's a mess ho, that's why they cut you out yo' own video
You dissin' for promo and dissing me is a no-no
I'm the queen of rings riches and dough ho
But back to the promo, yo I'mma still try and help you out
Ay y'all I'm talking bout Khia, dirty bitch of the south
Now what's beef?
Beef is when bitches titties lookin' like they sleep
Beef is when her clothes lookin' like dirty sheets
Beef is when I help you sell the records just like I do, now that's beef
What's beef?
Beef is when these hoes say mah name in the streets
Beef is when they fame only last a few weeks
Beef is when I help you sell the records just like I do, now that's beef
Yo' neck and you' back bitch, you know you was wrong
And ""K Wang"" ho? I ain't even like that song
Oh is all of this just over some dick?
I told you in my debut, Best Friends, I do five or six
Enough of that bitch, I got some other shit to address
About some pussy ass niggas with mah name in they tracks
Sayin' (Trina fucked Baby now she fuckin' Lil' Wayne)
You niggas snitchin on your records, fuckin' up a bitch name
You wouldn't do that to a nigga so why you do it to me?
You sounding like a ho nigga, why you slandering T?
Cause yous a Cash Money reject, a ninth ward soldier
Keep fuckin' with that boy and you gonna end up in a coma
And what about the waterboy, kid the silly
Last I heard you ain't even from Philly
So nigga keep the bitch women and let the players handle this shit
Cause you just dissin' for a deal but I'm dissing with the real, Yup
Now what's beef?
Beef is when the dope make a nigga fall asleep
Beef is when you sound like a muthafuckin' sheep (Ba Ba)
Beef is when I help you sell records just like I do, now that's beef
What's beef?
Beef is when a street nigga beefin' with a chick
Beef is when you brag on another nigga's dick
Beef is when I help you sell records just like I do, now that's beef, nigga
Fuck niggas
You niggas can't be serious
You niggas is real fuckin' funny to me

Six in the morning nigga at my do'
I'm trying to figure out what he out there foe'
Last time I seen him he was talking shit
Found out his new girl can't suck no dick
Hit the intercom I ain't let him in
Pussy nigga lucky I ain't fuck his friends
Probably thought a bitch would be down and out
Till he seen me riding round in that chromed out Benz
(Chorus)
South beach nigga you ain't bout that life
You cross that bridge they taking all that ice
You don't want no problems with them boys from the bottom strip ya ass butt naked and hit the turnpike
You's a fuck boy fuck boy

We went on trips you bought channel but money ain't shit when you soft as hell
Cause you's a fuck boy fuck boy my mama even said it
Gotta new nigga I ain't even gotta sweat it
You still gone talk and that's a god damn shame but a hoe gone be a hoe and a lame gone be a lame
Fuck boy

You never heard me asking niggas for shit
You be on the gram asking niggas for pics
Can't believe I let you waste all my time
Now this fuck boy on my voice-mail cryin
Runnin round town with ya bum ass hoe but I'm the blueprint that's why you at my door
She my number one fan that's what makes it sweet bitch'll do anything for a fucking re-tweet

35642,Trina,Hustling,"Hello to all my niggas and bitches
Welcome to Digglers Wild World of Girls
I'm sitting here with the Baddest Bitch (Thats Right)
So Trina tell us a little something about yourself
Hustla I'm the queen of this south shit
Tight with a cute face that's what I'm bout bitch
Sexy, specialize in fellatio
All about my pesos, never was a fake ho
Shot shore throw
Throw the cock like a flamethrower
In the mouth of a cock blower
Just a diva mack momma looking for them ends
Traded in the Lex for a G-5 Benz
Touring on the road getting stacks
20 grand karats for the show no tax
Bell-V is what I'm pourin on them hatas
Blinding with the lock no imitaders
Broke ass niggas getting on my nerves
Get sliced, diced, chopped, and served
Ask, am I off the chain? I won't lie
But I don't want your man boo fuck that guy, uh
Oh, okay, all right
I see how y'all be getting down in the MIA
But Trina what I really wanna know is
How would you get with a nigga who live with a bitch?
Wait... for his bitch to live
Ms. Trina gotta trick up her sleeve
Open up the door I walk straight in the house
Put your man down and put my cock in his mouth
(Damn) I need a heavyweight like Georgy Foreman
To work my ocean like the Long Shoreman
I'm real successful, I live off interests
So get it right bitch I'm the Diamond Princess
Banking and its all for the cause
(Hey Trina would you suck a nigga dick) Bitch hell naw
And fuck what a bitch tell yall
Stay the fuck outta mine ho and go get a job, ugh
Damn girl
You wild as fuck
But what I really wanna know is
How you set a motherfucker up...?
See a nigga pumpin gas, don't look
Get out your car slow drop your book
Sell em' with your name and your freak out game
And show a lil' shot of ass just to get in his brain
Tell em what he wanna hear, calm and slow
""You want this ass? Come on let's go""
Call my dawgs at the hotel, let em' know I'm coming
Bring em' upstairs and leave the car running
Get em' in the room don't be scared
Go in broke come out with bread
That's what a nigga get, playing with that cheese
Fun for a freaking, watch ya get skeeze
Out the door, real quick
Then out come my dawgs with the K's and shit
Thinking with your dick man that ain't nothing
(Trina one more thing) Naw no more questions
See now that's what I'm talking 'bout
We need more real motherfucking bitches representing real shit
You heard it live from the baddest bitch
Reporting live this is Ki Ki

I let you hoes rock, but now you hoes are trouble

I told him not to text me but he bought me VVS's
I am the Diamond Princess so I'm lovin' every second
Baptize him in my pussy, he said I'm such a blessin'
I'm the shit and I'm that bitch without a muthafuckin' doubt
Tryin' to come up off my name, you gets no muthafuckin' clout
I could even make it rain or cause a muthafuckin' drought
Cut the check and show respect and keep my name from out ya mouth, bitch

And I been the type of bitch to take everything
Niggas throw gifts and shit to see a bitch smile
And the house driveway about eight miles
They Froot Loop the wrist, they hit my PayPal
And these bitches can't take that I'm the wave now (Yeah)

He rubbing it on me, he wanna get naughty (Naughty)
But I know if I fall in my feelings, get deep and he bitin' the body
So I don't even play with him
Whitest man, hood stiff and his hands grabbing tight on my blue denim
My Louboutins, can a bitch feel 'em?
I let a nigga know quick, I'm a self-made go-getter
We body the body, he throwin' me keys to the Phantom big body (Big Body)
He shopping to buy, he import and export, I take classes, Pilates
Bank-bank account stretched like elastic
You can pop a rubber band or you can swipe the plastic
I make him blow the whole damn bank, do damage
'Cause if he don't swipe the card, you ain't a bad bitch (Yeah)

Champagne bubble bath, it's just me and him
Sex on dead presidents, I'm elite, ya bitch

Bet one phone call, he gon' come through
With a gift for the neck and the wrist, too
Girl, I know every password and the clothes blue
And if he throw me the Dutch, I could roll it, too (Roll it, too)
We body the body (The body)
I got his tongue deep in my body (In my body)
Like I'm riding the Harley, like police behind me, nobody can stop me
Girl, I ride a nigga's face like its first class
Can't stand no nigga who comes fast
Who be tryin' hard to get it? Back it up fast
Can't sauce the meat, a bitch gon' pass (Gon' pass)
We body the body (The body), now he cold, beatin' my body (My body)
Tellin' me all of his secrets, confessing to me that he don't want nobody
I break these niggas down like hoes

And now I never let a nigga get too close

The bank account full, I got workers
The bank account full, so much money in it
I could write a million checks and bet the check won't fucking dent it
Got so many M's you would swear a bitch was humming (hmmmmmmm)
Cause I live by 'you ain't talking money, you ain't talking nothing'
I'm sliding soft, my whip clean
I'm still the baddest bitch that you ever seen
Money ain't a problem
Money ain't a problem
I'm sliding soft, my whip clean
I'm still the baddest bitch that you ever seen
Money ain't a problem
Money ain't a problem
I ain't got no money problems
Money ain't a problem so I don't ever hate
I'm busy skipping lines while you bum bitches wait
2,000 plates, panoramic fucking views
You know it's Cinderella, you can tell by my shoes
That money ain't a problem so I don't ever hate
I'm busy skipping lines while you bum bitches wait
2,000 place, panoramic fucking views
I'm shitting on you bitches, bird flu
Million stunner, track race runner
Field goal punter, wild jungle hunter
I got diamonds in the backseat, chauffer, no taxi
Got the coupe painted yellow gold so you bitches know that's me
That's me, the bitch that you love to hate
If it's a heice, I'm the bitch that got away
If in the fight, you the bitch got put away
And I'm the bitch getting money each and every day

(so many memories)
You gotta let the tears fall for this one
(so many memories)
Breath
(so many memories)
9-27-82 born
Look into my eyes
I'm so torn
Slow down baby and get a clear view
Cause when you roll down your windows
I'm in your rear view
Hold on baby boy
I know its hard for ya
But ya girl got your back
And I'mma ride for ya
And I swear for god, I'd die for ya
How'd I look in your eyes and still lie to ya?
Now when you look in my eyes, I just cry to ya
Chris brown made it hard to say goodbye to ya
I still remember those days I got a dial tone
Tears falling from my eyes
But I held on
Now your memories are all I've got to live on
All outta my zone
I can't move on
Hurts worse than death
That you so gone
But the chapter is done
Poof, be gone
I wipe away my tears
I got my swag back
Word out on the streets is that ya girl is back
You must not know bout me
I got your name tattooed so the world could see
I dreamt one day we'd make we
A boy for you and a girl for me
But one day just outta the blue
That boy for you became a dream come true
(so many memories)
Now
I'm stressing
No resting
You chilling
Its killing
We... gone
Yea and now I'm back in my zone
I got so many saying I should leave it alone
Give it up let it go cause your boy is gone
Stop driving by his crib cause your boy ain't home
Stop looking at your pager and stop calling his phone
You better act like you fly and put your lip gloss on
Put your ass in ya jeans and get your grown girl on
You should've listened to your mama and picked up that phone
One call ain't hurt
I shed blood for you
And when them niggahs started hating I threw slugs for you
Now all that's left is what was of you
And now I wanna wake up cause there's no you
And now I'm down on my knees asking ""what'd I do?""
Cause baby life means nothing to me without you
Real love never dies that's what you told me
But now your love's flowing all through the industry
And now the media and press got a hold of we
And now the whole world knows that we ain't we
And she ain't we
And she ain't me
And she can never be
Listen up to em
Cause I'm talking to you
I got a message and its just for you
(so many memories)
Red carpet next to me is a good look for ya
Paparazzi snapping pictures for ya
You know I love the way you talk when you real high
You ? your bags when you come home and that's fly
Baby boy you kept it real and kept me looking nice
Made it rain in my purse each and every night
Back seat of the phantom made it look twice
And now its all just a memory of my life
One ring one watch one chain
One you one me one name
Just let me drown
Please don't save me
You know you should have held down a little harder baby
But now ya girl's on her own
No more carter baby
I said ya girl's on her own
No more carter baby
No kissing
No touching
No hugging
No snuggling
I'm missing your loving
My body can't function
Now I'm back on my grind
I gotta stay fly
Ya girl's hot
In the ? I'm so high
Haters all on my back but they can all die
Stunting just like you daddy no lie
Big spender
Big whipper
? sipper

U can keep your sad face baby hand me them keys

We can make it last
You and me
We can make it last
You and me...
It was me and you Trina who shared the hard times
Still in love wit niggas who was serving some hard times
Or involved wit niggas who lost their lives
When Hollywood passed I nearly lost my mind
I then rolled wit the traffickers worked in the Maximas
When D.A in back of us, I'm stretched out nervous
Asking myself, ""Bitch was this really worth it?""
What's my purpose I gotta keep searching
It was me and you Trina who asked the same questions
We decided when and which hoes we would fuck it
Shop wit thug wit get into some thug shit
Turn 'em on to niggas who deep into that thug shit
Get money fuck a little let a nigga touch a little
Had to make moves our home was so fucking little
Feel that? I know you do, guess what I wrote it too
Please recognize this is a hip hop quoteable

(And even through the loneliest time
We survived through our loneliest nights
Just think about the struggling times
When we survived through a nickel and dime
And even if I had all the bread in the world
I'd give it all up for one shot at
You and Me, I'm that same bitch)
You and me were best friends but I'm the one you talk about?
I showed love to everybody before I walked about
The parties the club the function
I leave you bring up discussions on who I'm fucking
You and me were best friends we talked about abortions
As little girls hair braided o the same porches
We promised each other we would share the same losses
Ya baby daddy passed we share the same losses
It was you and me ho getting c-notes
Bell hoppers to the death while Irish hoes deep throat
Yeah it's beef in the air and why she know
If anybody do she know how we flow
Miami bitches you know how we go
Nice entourage lock mints wonder bras
Sit in the club I miss how it was
 + (over lapping the chorus)
You know it's really funny how the tables turn
I moved forward and thank God for the lessons learned
I used to strip clubs as a stepping stone
Hit the stage got paid it wasn't my second home
Ask somebody Trina been the shit on the streets
Roll wrap late nights been the shit on the beach
Brought blue baby jeans just to shit on the ?
Keep tall body guys just to sit underneath
Sit back pop bottle ya'll sit on ya'll feet
Screaming my name tryna get in V.I.P
I don't own the club boo
I'm just showing love too
But every time I see ya face I think of me and you
It's disappointing that you fell off well not fell off
I just can't accept you not being well off

Don't lie to me; I'm what you try to be
I'm a big girl not a little girl

He had real money
All he ever asked ""never steal from me""
That was real shit
I'm a real bitch
He told me stay real and I'm a make you real rich
Back to reality
Is this real?
Big house on the hill far from Lincoln Field. (ohh)

Couldn't name a price that the nigga wouldn't pay
Snap my fingers he'll be over here today
If I asks, he'll rub my feet for days

Slap it in my face, shove it down my throat
Nigga, where your blunt? I can make this pussy smoke
I know how to fuck, I know how to ride
I can spin around and keep the dick still inside
Now your mouth wide, you looking real scared
I'm a maneater, headhunter, I'm prepared
Yeah you running now, you running
I'ma put this pussy on you just like this
Put this pussy in yo jaws now, smack
Like it's Thanksgiving and it ain?t coming back
Collard greens, neckbones, nigga chew this ass
Both hold inspections, don't stop 'til it pass
Licky licky licky licky licky for a hour
I'ma make it rain for you here's a golden shower
Smell it like a flower, my pussy is a rose
Come a little closer, I wanna fuck your nose
If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict
Look back at me, look back at me

Up all night, took pipe, gave head
Ass like Trina, face like Mya
Shot it on her chest she said, ""Daddy, aim higher""
Put jimmy on her titties and I bust off wicked
Gave her mayonnaise on the face, pearl necklace
We turned the camera on we did a sex scene
She called me R. Kelly and I called her
That?s my bitch right there nigga
Hand full of ass and a fist full of weed
Ass in the air, face down on your knees
I'm a beast when I fuck, I'ma put it in your gut
I'ma have you saying, ""No, please, let me get off""
I'ma make you say that's the spot don't take it out
I'm feeling like Akinyele, put it in your mouth
Kanye tell them gold digging hoes that we pimping in the South
And it ain't payday unless nuts in your mouth
If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it

Back at you for what?

Hit any party red carpet, bet I shut that down
Don't hate just go get yours
No excuses no more

Coz I'm that million dollar chick

I could throw a hundred million out the cockpit of my layer
That's dirty money (uh uh)
You starving hungry (that's right)
I got a million in singles
Take it all of, shake it for me
No renting, my millions hydro-planed
And I'm done with St Tropez'ng
In my lambo ice coat painted
I'm richer than all the riches in the world
You ain't no could be and I ain't tryna buy you
I'm tryna slide you, how about them Gucci?
He shower me in diamonds, I vacation for months
Penthouse at the Trump, In Las Vegas I'm Lady Love
Million dollar swell, I know I got you feinding
These shades is YSL
These heels ain't out till next season
I'm in that pink Ferrari, I got a thing for Porsches

Motherfuckers is so crazy, deranged
Let 'em into your brain brings misery and pain
Cause they call us lame, bitches, and heffers, and sluts
You think your nut is gonna heal my bruises and batters and cuts
Bitches ya'll better get tough
And at the same time y'all better lock the game
And re-rock the game
Get a Glock ready, sit back cock and aim

Why a bitch from the bottom gotta be so fly?
See them big boys steady on they grind, right?
So tell me how the hell I'm not supposed to be on mine
I learned the game from my 'ole girl

Riding in a foreign and he straight out the projects

Sit that bitch real low on them Forgis
Might fuck around and name dat bitch Trina
So I can get in it every time I see her
You ever rode with a nigga smell this good?
Ever fucked with a nigga that was this hood?
Put ya on ya stomach, eat that pussy from the back, baby

I wish I never met you boy …
If I can turn back time, then I'll make it so that you were my boo
I wish I never met you boy …
Every time I'm with my man, all I do is sit and think of you
Don't wanna feel the way I feel about you
When we first got together, I saw us chillin forever
A lifetime, best friend for worse or for better
Then you switched up the weather, sunshine to clouds
I found a condom in ya dresser, and you know how we get down
You fucking clown now I wish I never met cha
I shoulda listened to mama, she said you wasn't nothing special
So now its to the left, to the left
And everything you own is on the porch
Nigga step and tell me …
What would you do if u were in my shoes?
Would you make it go go or would u wanna choose
Between the one you love and between the one u hate
Cuz that's just how it is …
I wish I never met you boy …
And its killing me to know that I can't have you in my world
I wish I never met you boy …
If I can turn back time, then I'll make it so that you were my boo
I wish I never met you boy …
Every time I'm with my man, all I do is sit and think of you
Don't wanna feel the way I feel about you
Maybe im trippin, oh I just can't figure u out
One night u say u love me, the next u flippin out
But u can bounce, u kno I don't need a man
Im sorry I met u. I could do bad by my damn self
I can't let u disrespect me ima queen. And all my real
Boss chicks know what I mean
I bet u still trickin, you ain't learned ya lesson
Now let me check ya text messages … now tell me .. hahaaa
What would you do if u were in my shoes?
Would you make it go go or would u wanna choose

35685,Trina,No Games,"I won't play your games no more
I won't play your games no more
If you won't believe my motives or
If you want to leave this longing home
Well, I won't play your games no more
Last time I just broke down, he was playin' round with my freedom
Rude ways he would talk to me, I had to realize I didn't need him
Sex and my best friend when she really wasn't no bestie
A lot of shit was runnin' through my head but I was 'fraid they always gon' catch me
What did I gain? I lost everythin'
Got caught in this whip, I'm embarrassed, ashamed
All I got is my name, all I got is my name
So I crawled out of that dog pit and I shined bright as a diamond
So when the haters wished that I fell off, my fate made me keep climbin'
How was I lovin' and trustin' and fuckin' that nigga that ain't bein' real?
Why was I settlin' and let him play with my feelin's when I kept it real?
I just snapped, I pulled the trigger, 6 shots, third of December
Told that nigga had a bad temper, why he forget I'm a boss bitch
Told that hoe don't cross this, don't put me the middle that bullshit
'Cause I'm a real G's on some boss shit, I'm a real G and I'm a boss bitch
My heart, don't touch my heart
I made it clear from the start
If you break it, it's broke forever
But I guess he wasn't that smart
I won't play your games no more
I won't play your games no more
If you won't believe my motives or
If you want to leave this longing home
Well, I won't play your games no more
Who am I? I'm confused, been lost without direction
All the games and lies been told, I'm the one they question
Red and blue, strobe lights, 10 placed in the whole damn section
Stripped from all my everythin' 'cause now they had the weapon
Your Honor, it was self defence, no house, no picket fence
Now the State has evidence and they chargin' me with the precedence
Love has made a fool, love made me break the rules
Love never ever loved me, love turned out so uncool
How was I lovin' and trustin' and fuckin' that nigga that ain't bein' real?
Why was I settlin' and let him play with my feelin's when I kept it real?
I just snapped, I pulled the trigger, 6 shots, third of December
Told that nigga had a bad temper, why he forget I'm a boss bitch
Told that hoe don't cross this, don't put me the middle that bullshit
'Cause I'm a real G's on some boss shit, I'm a real G and I'm a boss bitch

You know, we do what we do we go our separate ways, but
Shit, lately, I been feelin' kinda different
Like, I been catchin' feelings for you and shit
You know when you call me Daddy and all that
Fuckin' with my head, for real
I never knew that I would fall so deep in love with her
Call me lover friend girl we was just hushin' it up
You got me feenin' for more
When other niggas used to call you after midnight
It never bothered me, girl we was only friends, right?
So why does it hurt more and more?
Girl I get excited whenever you call my phone
I got a special ringer whenever you call me girl it goes
""I can't leave you alone"" (remember that?)
You got me feenin' (yeah!) feenin' (shit) feenin'
So baby I'm pleading for you to bring your body home to me and let me lay you down
Bring your body home to daddy (bring it home)

Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on (yeah, yeah)

Baby you're my sexy little mama (you are)
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on
I'm tired of the fightin' the fussin' and cussin'
Late night discussions of who you think I'm fuckin'
You puttin' me on guilt-trips like I can't see
You storin' his name for hers in your caller ID
Look I'm a Queen, the Don Diva
We should just flee in the lime green Seline two-seater you and me
My top down and yes my hair is blowin'
Flashbacks of you and me, got me moanin' but 
Who you lovin' who you wanna be huggin'
I seen her in your six hundred and you claim it's your cousin
Look I know we agreed to, to see other people
But those feelings were shallow like my lingerie see-through
We both played this game unfaithfully (that's right)
See me with the next man and now you wanna play with me
Yo' I'm confused but I still wanna proceed
Without you I'm incomplete, you make me so weak
I love it when you say...
I remember, late nights we would just kiss
I remember wearin' them girdles, and takin' them trips
And I remember that we said it would never come to this
Never let something come between our relationship
Now how can I leave you to be with someone else
Without finding out, how you truly felt
All the ridin' on horses and creepin' and abortions
Thoughts of marriage, all white playin' organs
It started from the rough sex (ah!) on the deck of the yacht
Followed by Don Perion and the Canary watch

Ain't no need for player haters acting funny
Come on, all my ladies, let's get this money
Come on, all my fellas, let's get this money
Trina finna show you how to get this money, right
You gotta have a J-O-B to be with me
Best believe I'm going diamond on my next LP
I stacked my game up, sexed my frame up
Bitches using my style, I'm set to change up
Unh, new year, new gray Jag
After the first album, you should hear Shay brag
I been around the world playing 2-way tag
While these wannabe Trinas out here claim bad
But guess what, I'm still the baddest
Jewels still flooded with 24 karats
OK, you know I live lavish
Chanel glass slippers in a Cinderella palace
Unh, unh, See me on South Beach rolling the five
When I come through hoes rolling they eyes
I'm the- baddest bitch, so I'm used to that
Draped in the hot shit off the Gucci rack
I like Tiffany ice, that expensive stuff
The diamond princess draped in princess cuts
Don't be mad ho, cause I'm that bad ho
Pushing that pink Lamborghini Diablo
I play niggas like dummies for the fast money
You wanna holla, it's gon' cost you cash money
Slip and slide, then we stacking chips
The redbone, wonder woman with the platinum wrist
Breakdown
Miami hot, 'Candy' flopped
I'm the new bad girl and I can't be stopped
Unh, sipping Bailey's, flossing daily
On TRL with Carson Daly
Dressed to kill, ice, extra chill
Touch of class, bad with the sex appeal
Flawless baby, female ballers baby
Stay diggin' in them millionaires wallets baby
Tored up, Christian Dior'd up
Cases of that Cris, gettin poured up
Got it sewed up, like stitches
Reppin' for my bad bitches, stackin' riches
I shine, baby cause the game is mine
I'm on top of the charts, no room to climb
And when I say I'm the baddest, I'm mean it
Me and this cash, can't nothing come between this

This cold world had me num the pain like novacaine
Till mama sat me down unfold the gate
Showed me the straight path through the narrow lane
Sunshine after rain the joy of pain
Mama you raised a good girl dont worry
You used to say take it slow trina dont hurry
Use to tuck me in with the bedtime story
Now I grown up and you still there for me
My shoulder to lean on
You kept my dreams goin
I owe it all to you me now I got the green flowing
And im gon always be yo baby
And I  can't never repay you for all the things that you gave me
You raised me to be a lady
And you scoot me to the game so them niggas couldn't play me
You was more than a mother you was a friend
The greatest love of all comes from within
I know ill never kknow love like this again
And beneath my wings you was the wind
I love you like none other
Cause you can only live your whole life but only get one mother
Being there for me through the thick and thin
More than a mother your my best friend
Look within and take yo place
Sometimes I wanna run to ya
Through the ups and downs I know I can still come to ya
I think bout the things I done to ya
But through all the drama I know I'm still number one to ya
Uh, look at how far you brought me
All the things you have taught me
Money couldn't bought me
You never wanted us to make the same mistakes
When the game got high and they raised the stakes
You was still in my corner to press the brace
Till I'm ready in yo arms you kept me safe
Through the thick and thin im gon be there for ya
I say a prayer for ya
Lord knows I care for ya
Through hard times we got strong  or mother to daughter
When I was weak you was my bridge over trouble water
Can't nobody replace you
I'm forever faithful
For you mama im grateful
Your baby girl is a reflection of you
I thank the lord up above cause he blessed me with you, uh
I love you like none other

He questioned me ""I'm I defying (no),"" I was lyin
He was a real good man, he worked and all
I wanted a hustle, so I can hurt the mall (shit)
I coulda made love, but I wanted to be fucked
He had a lot to offer it just wasn't enough
I like da candle-coated 'lac (uh huh) the niggas smokin sacks (i like da thugs)
The football games, fortunate and fame
And more importantly, I wanted me a name
The je-wells, the crew-es, the cell
No more projects, the foolish gets well (I'm tired of dat shit)

And me, I'm still ghetto I push ah (?) when you see me on TV

Da fast pace, the comfy cash chase
Da clothes, cars, ohhh God

Bitches sell pussy get rich, get down or don't get shit (dats right)
No options, no college, no loans
No cash, No knowledge
I'm sexy as hell you know I'm gon profit
And trust me, my skills are well polished
I chat niggas down pat niggas down
Set him up right if he dat big a clown

I wanted a Rolly a million dat'll hold me
Lock a access for Colby you know me (uh)

Fuck the Cris, I just give it how I get it
I'm the spokesperson 4 ev'ry sista who soul seachin
Still strollin these clubs with no purpose
Stay in the mall and won't purchase
Straight boostin
Bad checks or they leasin they mouth
Robbers put a piece in their mouth
For whatcha man keep in their house
They pull gats for stacks tall as Shaq
You chickens don't know me well
I'm not impressed witcha Findi purses and ponytails
Always surface with your phony tails
When you need to be in school all day on a chase
I'm goin to work supported you and ur place
Or with a athletic wit a cool one in the safe
Why suck dick to keep food on the place

Giuseppe's never looked so nice on a queen
The ghost pod’s reflection, the hairy glisten bling
Standing ovations and the sold out show days
I’ve been winning since recording a dat tapes
So what a bitch hate, that’s what they made for
And I’m the competition I’m what they can’t fuck
Prolific, profound and gifted, I don’t hear these bitches
Bopping so I don’t get tempted
In my own lane and a queen till the death of me
The bitches claim they bad but the only thing bad is me
Stirred up, body chemist cooking chemistry
I can’t be duplicated so they all choose to follow me
These birds are pictures of trash and fire and when my pen
Losses ink, that’s the day I retire, I never expire
I pray to a God that’s higher, he promised me a long time
He give me all I desire

But I don’t know how
I’m too far, to turn back now
You know I’d reach the peak
But I don’t know how
I’m sitting on airplanes/spaceships
I’m an astronaut, with real curf tips
Million dollar whips, I take space trips
I sip starbucks and spend space chips
I play 50 cent moka I’m on vh1
Now tell me something that a bitch done that I ain’t done
To not be feeling left out like I am the one
Fuck an award, it’s political
I’ve been hot as the sun
I’ve been getting to the money like it’s nothing
I’ve been rocking Chanel no per diem no budget
I’m on my own shit and you hoes no money
I can’t take you under cause you thirst for the money
Bitches never had nothing till the game gave it to em

While I’m most consistent, why the rockstars love me
Why I’m on my 6th album, why your man wanna fuck me
Why the movie screen calling, why I ain’t stop balling
Why you throwing sneak disses if I really ain’t the target
Why they throw me on the cover, why my ass so fat
Yeah my ass is a movie, you should see it from the back
And it’s hd, high definition
If I never started rapping, all this ass you’d be missing
You’d be in the same position, listening to corny bitches
All the lies that they telling and the fantasies they wishing

1 ContributorHold You Down Lyrics
You might be crazy but I love it
Showin' off in public 'cause you drunk
Bae, why you trippin'?
If I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
And if I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
I'ma hold you down, down
This is the last time we gon' talk about it
When I say that I'm loyal, you should never doubt it
Take your sheets off the troop, pull back the covers
Yeah, it's been a few who claim to be lovers
But uh, the truth it, I'm kinda done with it
Give a nigga your all and put your heart in it
Get hooked to the dick, be a star with it
Now the house up in flames, I threw a match in it
I'ma play my part, see the script is written
Just let me be the only bad bitch who hittin'
Shot gun position, I gree on every decision
Never let us outside, throw us off the mission
If you see this vision, we can go real far
Further than the moon, I can be your superstar
I tried to tell these niggas, I'm the truth from the start
But they don't seem to get their part
You might be crazy but I love it
Showin' off in public 'cause you drunk
Bae, why you trippin'?
If I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
And if I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
I'ma hold you down, down
Ain't no bitch better, please
They all steal pieces for me, I'm the wet dream
What every man need, the viewers' choice, that's me
What you confused 'bout? What you need?
All and all, I'm a work in progress
So I never thought you, I can hand you off
Just prepare for everythin', steal the fortress
See I got you nigga, just don't make me regret
Opened up my heart for you, nigga
Let's get money, invest, make figures
Sail the ocean on yachts and shit, TMZ's tellin' lies
Let 'em snap a pic, so unfortunate
That they with you, knowin' me
We laugh at the bullshit, we one team
I tried to tell these niggas, I'm the truth from the start
But they don't seem to get their part
You might be crazy but I love it
Showin' off in public 'cause you drunk
Bae, why you trippin'?
If I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
And if I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
I'ma hold you down, down
You might be crazy but I love it

But first let me tell you what's on my mind
In between these legs, everythin' is mine
Gotta beat this good 'til the break of dawn
Be the only real nigga that I'm slobbin' on
Come between these thighs and give this thing a kiss
Now come on baby, we can do this

Well you ain't no boss and I ain't gon' wait
I'm a bad bitch and a pissy prin
Attitude kinda cocky, yeah, a little sadity
You can lick this ass up and down
Lick it 'til your turn turn dodo brown
Don't try to be stiff and give me a kiss
Now come on baby, we can do this
Lock me lock and load, then ride your face
Don't put your tongue in it 'til you say your Grace
Your lips smackin' is all I hear
Give me that head then I wanna swear
Gotta beat me good like a 
When the police come, I don't know nothin'
But I'm still like like big toes suckin'
'Cause without that bag, we ain't fuckin'
I need a tongue that's long and a back that's strong
Bring a whole lot of kush that'll get me in the zone
Now beat that meat, aim to hit it
Now when you shoot that nut, let me babysit it
A lil nasty hoe, red bone
But a classy hoe, real jazzy hoe
Don't be scared and if you curious, just ask me, hoe
And yes,  cuff quite natural

Do you really wanna know what hard work is? Ask me and I'll tell you
From nothing to something
If there is a will there is a way
Traveling city to city, state to state
Non stop shows, interviews all over the globe
I am Miami
Magazine covers, gossips number 1 topic
The life of the rich and famous
Fans who can relate, from the beginning till now
Trashy mouth, too sophisticated lady
Not just a rapper but a businesswoman still standing
When I've seen others come and go, I rise
Grateful for my struggles and the road that I took
It only made me stronger, it prepared me for this
For the here and now, focused and eager to learn
Fast to teach, this is not a game
This is my life
Fairy tales don't exist over here, I'm a realist
And strong is just another statement to describe me
And now I ask you the same question again
Who is Trina?  She is amazing
I'm amazin', so amazin'
I'm amazin', I'm amazin'
I'm amazin', I'm amazin'
I'm a...
I'm a first round pick, yup, the lucky lotto numbers 777
The haters could never take me under promise if I fall, won't be down to long
Your psychic is wrong, tell that chick I sang this song
I own the throne, any other chick she follow
I'm her role model, I don't use a bottle
I breast feed the game like there's tomorrow
I can tell you about pain and talk about sorrow
Bitches ain't shit and niggas ain't either
Niggas want ya chick, better watch the way you treat her
You shouldn't have to beat her
Lose her the way you meet her
When a woman's fed up, better watch the way you treat her
I'm way past a diva, I'm outta ya league
I'm something ya need, I'm front page, something to read
I said I'm way past a diva, I'm outta ya league
I'm something ya need, a front page, something to read

Beat the drum, blow the horn

Heres a new Louis bag for you to shut your mouth!
Roll out the red carpet!
Bring the trumpets out!
Cause the word on the street says I own the south!
If you really want it, baby we got it
We got the fire, you’ve been waiting for

Sitting in your windows, I’m gone
I’m in the fast lane, on any corner
And I’m breaking the crack game

Take you out your misery!
I give ‘em more bounce to the ounce!
I’ma show ‘em things they can't even pronounce

Your a bone thug, you’re not a fighter

And once I put my game down his main bitch is through
My ass fatter when I make it clap, oh, that's when shit get real
And you're damn right, I can't do shit with a nigga that's still in the gym

Do you Trina take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband
To have and to hold from this day forward
For better or for worse
For richer for poorer
In sickness and in health
To love and to cherish
Form this day forward
Until death do you part
Uh!
I guess I wasn't enough for you
The things I done for you
Call me I run to you
Whenever you want me to
What have I done to make you hurt me a time or two
Probably more then a few
My heart still beats for you
Wonder what did I do
Damn I should've knew
But still didn't have a clue
My life would be so blue
Yeah I'm hurt it's true
Not feeling me next to you
Laughing at things you do
Kissing and calling me boo
Now it's hard to eat
Damn I feel so weak
And I can't get no sleep
My eyes continue to leak
Pouring out like the rain
This hurts more then pain
Apologizes with the pain
I went against the brain
Baby please don't go
I need you more n more
I'm breaking down on the floor
One thing you should know
Is that I got you
No matter who tells you that
The love we had was wack
Know that I need you back here

I open my heart to you
I changed the game for you
Gave up my friends for you
My life just ain't the same
I'm Reaching n calling your name
Remember the things I do
Cooking and cleaning for you
Taking good care of you and
Making sweet love to you
Baby just close your eyes
And picture my hips and thighs
Laying right next to you
I'm getting the best of you
Tell me you need me back
I promise I'm running right back
How did It come to this
Why did you run from this
My loving you got to miss
With you I was full of bliss
Baby please don't go
I just can't take no more
I'm screaming and kicking
Cause really I needs to know
Tell me she's not the one
Tell me I'm number one
And baby can you please tell me and you are still one

I'm just tryna make sure that you hear me out there
Now when you see the queen coming
And the horn start blowing
(Ay yoh Trina)
Everybody start running
People in the streets coming
(It's been a while baby
But they still gotta bow down to the queen, ha-ha yea)
Now when you see the queen coming
And all the horns start blowing
Everybody start running
People in the streets coming

Make way, make way, make way
Make way whoaaaa
They see the fireworks blowing
And the roof start smoking
And you know it ain't a game
Recognize this woman, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way, way
Every time I turn the t.v. on, all I see is Trina
Everybody so quick to judge me
Look how you point the finger
Saying he's to good for me when you don't even know me
You're too lonely, you need to worry bout yours only
Like a rag you throw me
Some pretend they don't know me
BET you know you owe me, show me homie
Tryna steal my pride, they make me go harder
Do I worry? I don't bother
I'ma finish what I started
Working more than 9 to 5
Keeping the Slip-n-Slide dream alive
Look at some of these chicks that try
Half of them lost their flame, they died
While I been walking on fire
I'm yearning to go higher
Never kicked out the game, I shall retire
Now put that on The Wire
I grab the game like pliers
I'm doing the whole dash, staring like I'm wearing tires
Can't  studio to stage
My people gotta make way
For queen before I clear the streets
Now when you see the queen coming
And all the horns start blowing
Everybody start running
People in the streets coming
Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way whoaaaa
They see the fireworks blowing
And the roof start smoking
And you know it ain't a game
Recognize this woman, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way, way
What makes you think this life more easier for me
If you can only see, it ain't all that is crack up to be
More money, more problems when you living like this
If you ain't making hits, then you ain't about shit
Fans go to talking, the neighbors go to shopping
Am I'm really human?  when I go to 
Huffin' an the puffin', tears start fallin'
The the whole turns cold
That's when you wanna pick your coffin
But I ain't giving up, I ain't never be a quiter
I go hard on everything, I'm a natural born winner
Natural born sinner but I'm praying for forgiveness
Some-times I pinch myself then I realize I live this
Some say relentless, I say forgiveness
That's when I pinch myself and than I realize I live this
Some say relentless, I say forgiveness
That's when I pinch myself and then I realize I live this
Now when you see the queen coming

I'm down to your stomach so you know what's coming next

That it's all yours
Make me drip like a fountain

Anythin' that you want, anythin' that you could have
I ain't window shoppin', shawty, throw it in the bag
I'm from the bottom of the map, I made from the top
The skyline bluer than the blocks in my watch
My baby scream my name (Ross) every time it rains
I know she feel my pain, shawty, nothin' goes in vein
All I do is smile at the bumps and the bruises
Cruisin' in the coupe, or jump in a Land Cruiser
Our relationship is far more sacred
Success complicates it, so back to the basics
Wishin' I could buy time
Eyes closed just picturin' the skyline
If you wanna go up high
I'll make it worth your while
To the penthouse suite, just you and me
Carry the ocean on in privacy
If you wanna go up high
Like diamonds in the sky (you know my view)
To the penthouse suite, just you and me (that's what's important to me
Pull the curtains back so you can see (skyline)
The skyline
All this for me? Skyline
I'm lovin' it, skyline
You could be anywhere in the world right now, skyline
But you with me
I done heard it all from the ying to the yang
I done brought it all, Louis V to Vera Wang
I went from coach to first class on all flights
Then coach to Hermes, all ice
I put my life in this music and been around the world
Most men are losers, I put that on my words
Like my top in the summertime, nigga, get lost
I need fresh air, so it's time to take off
I might get a massage, I might have a menage
I might sit back and watch and play like I'm LeBron
Baby still the bomb, you ladies not a threat
When I detonate a man, whole face went
You better check yourself 'cause I could write a check
My skyline blue so my view is the best
I was 17 in the blue VVS
You didn't have a clue, greyin' shoes was a mess
Shine comes with time, mine came with grindin'
Every day I'm alive, I'ma put it on the line
If you wanna go up high
I'll make it worth your while

Icy blue rocks on my arm I shop at Malone for Louie Vinton
The diamond diva miss Cinderella, Versace gown by Donna Tella
And can't none of these hoes out floss me
Gator boots by Sergio Rossi
Ms. Trina I got to splurge, 58 frame baby watch the curves
Walk in the club don't waste no time
Hit the bar up two cases of wine
Cute face thin waste line
Drop to the beat pop to the base line
To all my girls that's kickin it
You got Chris in yo glass and you sippin it
You bout money and you gettin it
We tight that's right. Uh
(Hey) This how we do!
(Hooo) Yall can't deny
(Hey) This how we do (whoa)
I'm the baddest far from the average (Hey)
Diamond Princess (whoa)
Ghetto F-a-b (hey)
This how we do (whoa)
I like my ladies off the glass like shotin off the back board
Sexiest mommies beautiful as black broads
Cutest rude girl, thick as Caucasian
Pretty as conversions, slick as malatians
Ask them let them bitches say yes sir
Young and live among riches in West Jerve
Switch in the excurve
Strut through this bitch in the best furs
Bitch in a Lex Jerse
Twin gray crosses (bling) I'm the might cone
Brightly chrome vendaidoes
Cover your girl face
From the Bruce Lee Roy glow
On a mother a pearl face
All I do is say one word
Yall say it's foolish
I send splurge
I'm a lose 1/3
I never go broke my name got to o's
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S
Nice lips, nice thighs, nice hips
Pussy tighter then a pair of vice grips
I don't pay niggas, niggas pay me
(I'm a hustler baby) like Jay-Z
It's the diamond princess million dollar mistress
From the M-I home of the stop bitches
Christal, and caviar bitches, twist this game for all you fly bitches
I Spit nuttin but the hot shit, you got the four dot get the four dot six
Maybe than you can ride with a hot bitch
VS from the anklet to the wrist
I been in the game just two years

But I don't know, I've come too far, I've come too far yeah, too far
Don't know how yeah
A hundred giuseppes never looked so nice on a queen
The ghost pod's reflection, the hairy glisten bling
Standing ovations and the sold out show days
I've been winning since recording a dat tapes
So what a bitch hate, that's what they made for
And I'm the competition I'm what they can't fuck
Prolific, profound and gifted, I don't hear these bitches
Bopping so I don't get tempted
In my own lane and a queen till the death of me
The bitches claim they bad but the only thing bad is me
Sterved up, now the chemist cooking chemistry
I can't be duplicated so they all choose to follow me
These birds are pictures of trash, if I... I'm with my pen
Losses ink, that's the day I retire, I never expire
I pray to a God that's higher, he promised me a long time
He give me all I desire
I'm too far, to turn back now
You know I'd reach the peak
But I don't know how
I'm too far, to turn back now
You know I'd reach the peak
But I don't know how
I'm sitting on airplanes/spaceships
I'm an astronaut, with real curf tips
Million dollar whips, I take space trips
I sip starbucks and spend space chips
I play 50 cent moka I'm on vh1
Now tell me something that a bitch done that I ain't done
To not be feeling left out like I am the one
Fucking the world, it's political
I've been hot as the sun
I've been getting to the money like it's nothing
I've been rocking chanel, no... no fuck shit
I'm on my own shit and you hoes no money
I can't take you under cause you thirst for the money
Bitches never had nothing till the game gave it to em
And now they getting money, the... game to them
In my own lane and a queen till the death of me

I'm too far, to turn back now

But I don't know how
I'm too far, to turn back now
I reached the peak
But I don't know how
If you was thinking that it was over
Leprechaun, here's my 4 leaf clover
But I don't need luck, I've been prayed up
While they was sleeping, I'm the same bitch who stayed up
While I'm most persistend, why the rockstars love me
Why I'm on my 6th album, why your man wanna fuck me
Why the movie screen calling, why I ain't stop balling
Why you throwing sneak disses if I really ain't the target
Why they throw me on the cover, why my ass so fat
Yeah my ass is a movie, you should see it from the back
And it's hd, high definition
If I never started rapping, all this ass you'd be missing
You'd be in the same position, listening to corny...
All the lies that they telling and the fantasies they wishing
In my own lane and a queen till the death of me
The bitches claim they bad but the only thing bad is me

You want that ice on your hands with the birds 'round your neck

I guess I'm still Da Baddest yea that's what I'm guessin (uh)
Pineapple Ciroc a double shot of white
I got a bag full of money that will change up ya life
Fort Knox in the basement, gold bars forever
Lyrics turn to bars they'll remember me forever (yeah)
Short change is what I call them broads
I got acres in my crib, book these shows on my lawn
Red Eye flights, Miami here I come
I only fornicate with bread cause that money make me cum
See that villa out in Cali, mansion on the mountain
I slide this pussy on him call it slidin down the mountain (uh)
Pussy whipped but all I see is the crown, stiletto Louboutins, Hermes gown
You bum bitches don't make a sound cause when my flight touch ground I shut yo whole city down
You hoes wanted to rap, I wanted to shop
So I sat in the trap and I cooked up the blocks
Made blocks squares, now I'm pushin a yacht
To mansion with spiral stairs, to a Palm Beach out in Laud (yeah)
(Huh) I gotta whole lotta everything, never married but a whole lotta wedding rings
From rappers and ball players that smelt the g-string
Groupie niggas who I turned household names
Street bitch and I been bout money
If I had to be honest I don't need this rap money
Cause the pussy gone sell more than rap show money
Fuck I need a pimp for CEOing my money (preach)
(Yeah) and you a rap bitch dummy, and a lil dick nigga can't do nothing for me
And I still don't know nann bitch who can come for me
These bum ass bitches Kevin Hart mad funny
No Lie!
I'm the shit don't push me I get ruthless
Stashed burner on deck where the coupe is
I ain't hard to find, you hoes can come and meet me
I am always in the press I am ""Hip-Hop Weekly""
(Mid-Mid) Middle finger blowing smoke to the Paps
A couple mill you'll get a photo of my crotch
No panties, no sweat and it's wet
Me and you no phones fucking on a closed set

You should see me in that thong th-th-thong thong
I make this ass bounce, and these titties right
And make my thighs tremble, cause that's what niggas like
I got this thing alright, you better ask somebody
And if he ask about me, he better pack his wallet
See I'm a guy pleaser, slash don diva
Slip-N-Slide off the side yeah that's Trina
Take it to the bar, give me Grey Goose
Let me get it started, it's time to tear it loose
Catch a wall, back it up, oh excuse me!

See I'm a cutie, yours truly
Get out the way of this motherf**kin cooly

Every nigga in the club wanna get in my panties
But, if he payin it I'm layin him
And if the nigga still standin I consider him the man then
He wanna cram it and jam it
Put the pickle in the middle muh'f**ker not the fanny
That access has not been granted
It's the way that I strut, make a nigga wanna f**k and
It's the lust make a nigga wanna touch
And I'm not just a ho or a slut, I'm a plus so
Where you ducks at? Where yo' bucks at?
If he ain't up in that, get the f**k back
See I done struck back just like lightning
Every nigga in this bitch wanna pipe me

And I'm, signin his checks while givin him sex, and

Break his bank down to his last gold dollar

Wild ones, walk wit a bitch through wild slums
Trying to figure out if they're scared of the hips or the chips
Or they really can't talk to a bitch wit wild guns
No games, hat to the side wit low frame

When I get it, I'ma take control
If it get too fast, I'ma take it slow (Take it slow)
If it get too fast, I'ma take it slow (Take it slow)
If it get too fast
Look I got the feeling you been fiending my body
I see us leaving the party, now tell me what you gonna do
Somebody told me you been thinking about me
And I been thinking it probably could be me on you
So come on shawty we could creep into the bed
Get into some more freaky shit
Then we could go back to the crib
Take a look at how I live, take a sip
Let me show you how deep it get
Now we could do it real fast, we could do it slow
I like it when he make it last, 'till he gotta go
He like the way I move that ass, then I make it poke out
Then smoked out the Jag, then we on the roll
And took a ride down Lake Shore Drive, Stay so high
Flipping through the city, nigga ain no dye
Stay so fly, I could take your guy
Cause they know I got the bomb, and I ain't no lie
Play the song on the radio, gotta let my baby know
When I get it, I'ma take control
If it get too fast, I'ma take it slow (Take it slow)
If it get too fast, I'ma take it slow (Take it slow)
If it get too fast
Play the song on the radio, gotta let my baby know
When I get it, I'ma take control
If it get too fast, I'ma take it slow (Take it slow)
If it get too fast, I'ma take it slow (Take it slow)
If it get too fast
Look I think I really need time to breathe
Because I know what we doing ain't right
And he be on me every time I see him
Because he know me and dude ain't tight
He wanna see me in the middle of the night
Wanna fuck in the middle of the fight
We break up to make up
But when we make love he suck, and he nibble, and he bite
But I know I gotta chill cause now I'm seeing that it's real
That my dude checking all the phone bills, Just still
I know you gotta girl who be all up off in your grill
She be checking through ya pages, talking all at the crib, damn
Should of known what the shit might do
Fucking with a nigga like cool, go on in the Brans
Switching lanes in the midnight blue
So ya please gotta
Play the song on the radio, gotta let my baby know
When I get it, I'ma take control
If it get too fast, I'ma take it slow (Take it slow)
If it get too fast, I'ma take it slow (Take it slow)

When I get it, I'ma take control
If it get too fast, I'ma take it slow (Take it slow)
If it get too fast, I'ma take it slow (Take it slow)
If it get too fast
Luda! Ludacris don't play
When it come to the sex, if it get too fast
I'ma take it a little slower
Then speed it back up like Shaquille O'Neal
The back board, I'll break it, take it, never fake it, shake it
Run around my house butt naked
If you throw it good enough
Then daddy might buy your ass a tennis bracelet
'Cause I got so much dough, I don't know what to do with it
Plus I got so much dro, I roll it up and let you hit it
Lay back, way back, stay back
Like Puff take that, take that, take that
Young Bobby V. and Ludacris and Shawn
Will make you hit that playback, like four times, I'll co-sign
You so fine, L;et me hit one more time
Cause I got that goody good, and I think I shouldy should
Pack ya with the woody wood, I'm just so hoody hood

Shawnna kick hot shit for bitches that got they baby daddies locked
In the pen gone; fittin to rot cause he did wrong
Run up on the cops and he hit 'em with the Glock left his wig home
Sellin rock on the big phone
In the projects niggas run up on your set with the tech' out
Leave you wet with you chest out
Killer niggas realer niggas have a nigga fill a never realer nigga
Drill a nigga fuckin with a villian never spill a nigga
Fuck that! Nigga bust back, we in the 'Llac
Me and my bitches all strapped
Puffin thе sack and we be sippin on 'gnac
Fittin to react, and pop a nigga for thеm stacks (OOH-OOOH!)
Niggas I'm with they put the fifth to your whole melon
I'm with the murderers and known felons
I gotta pop a nigga drop a nigga rock a nigga shock a nigga
Lock a nigga fuck a nigga, cop the floppin nigga
Roll for my bitches that be droppin in the strip clubs
Tryin get 'em a lil' somethin
If you gotta take it off, take it off like a boss for the big ones
Then you get you a big gun
Motherfuckers in the Chi like to put it yo' eye if it's on bitch
Put it straight to you don't miss
Now you fuckin with them gangsters, ballers, hoes, hustlers
Bangers - niggas that with them real motherfuckers like whoa!
It's real real - on the block I been up for days
I gotta keep the steel steel - in case a nigga wanna get in the way
So now what's the deal deal? On the street you got nothin to say
So when I see him I'ma get him (WHAT!) drill him (WHAT!)
Fill him fill him (WHAT WHAT!)
Twista kick hot shit for hoes and thugs
In ghettoes and clubs that get crunk; for my homies locked down
To whoever hurtin in the hood and ballers with 22's on big trucks
To my thugs that call over to they mob
And to the hustlers that be servin hydro and cocaine
To my niggas that ain't hoes; if they have to
They will steal a nigga touch a nigga check a nigga cut a nigga
Pull the trigger bust a nigga, yellow motherfucker nigga
Ready to fill and spill a drink, I'm drunk go and weed it up
And I'm talkin about go like I'm smokin the bone
Full of some shit that damn sho' wouldn't seed it up
Got you feelin the holy ghost through your body
Probably reanimated with all my Legit Ballaz rollin up
Up the streets stuffed the beats
So you see them Navigators, Escalades, Benzes
Beamers, Excursions - bumpin systems TV's and them 20's spinnin
Mob for them niggas that done came up off them hard times
K-Town, West side, South side
Murder us for the money that's why I'm known to kick a hard rhyme
Whatever set you represent throw it up
If you buck or crunk then take yo' motherfuckin shirt off
Dealers get your work off; you wanna party
Full of hustle niggas killer niggas gangsta niggas chill niggas
Baller niggas thug niggas player haters real niggas
It's real real - on the block I been up for days
I gotta keep the steel steel - in case a nigga wanna get in the way
So now what's the deal deal? On the street you got nothin to say
So when I see him I'ma get him (WHAT!) drill him (WHAT!)
Fill him fill him (WHAT WHAT!)
I'ma kick hot shit for bitches up in the industry tryin to compete me
I'm from the hood South side, West side
Where niggas'll put a motherfuckin slug in my enemy
Motown, Pucketown, do or die
The difference between a motherfuckin thug and a gangsta
One's thug in a chamber
Get a nigga stick a nigga put him in a ditch and then forget a nigga
Hit a nigga pop a nigga little with the rocket nigga
Puff pass say you love that
We in the 'Llac and put the lemon in the 'gnac
Remy and sacks that got me scummy in the back
Puffin the raps that got me layin out slacks
And it's speakin like, ""Wow, that, blunt let me hit the weed""
Cause I been feelin like
Fuck a nigga bust a nigga Shawnna never love a nigga
Chi about to show the motherfuckers how to rush a nigga
Crush that put it on momma
On everything I got a thang for the drama, puff marijuana
To things Shawnna gonna throw it on ya
Flows leave you froze in a comma
We so relentless, you know Chi gone bring the business
Blows to yo' dome in an instance
Home of them Folks and the Mo's and the King's and the Fo's
And the BD's and lows and the fiends and the hoes and God!
It's real real - on the block I been up for days
I gotta keep the steel steel - in case a nigga wanna get in the way
So now what's the deal deal? On the street you got nothin to say
So when I see him I'ma get him (WHAT!) drill him (WHAT!)

You know I keep it Dickie down get it to my toe
And when you see me reachin fa that itchy hit da flo'

Like we ain't getting in do this nigga really know
We push him to da side and we make it through the club
They try to show me love, erebody want a hug
And now they tryin to hit me wit the bottles of the bub
But I be rollin sticky shawty hit me wit da dub
And now I got my hands up feelin real tight
We pourin out the Cognac buckin where the light

Before I hit the stage I see some niggas finna fight
And now they on they monkey bone missin up my flow
But yo I know you heard about the niggas from the go
Roll up anotha B I see 'em slick its on the low
Here come security they tryin to kick us out the door. Oh

Got a couple of them stacks finna mix it wit the Co-ni-ac

Stupid niggas at the door tryin to say they wanna see I.D
Weight a minute, weight a minute

Candy coated Monte Carlo wit the upgrain
Weight a minute now they wanna see a bitch ball
I'm iced out from my tittie to my tip toe
We at the bar finna but the whole thang out
And if somebody wanna start we can bang out
I let my chain swang down to my waistline
I won't dance we just move the baseline
And tell a nigga weight a minute 'fore I take mine
'Fore we do you like a victim of a hate crime

If I ain't rappin then I'm scratchin off a serial
I'm bout to get this thang crackin out the sterio
You want a bitch to make it happen nigga here it go

And take me home try to turn we into wifey

You bought a bottle for the crew, we buyin two or three
Just tryin to show you how we do the thang usually
I holla to my nigga Weezy Wee and Deucie D
Now let my bitches in the club 'fore we shut it down
And matter fact g where I'm from they don't come around
And now they got me on Bicardi and the butta brown
And everybody in the party wanna run around
But I ain't trippin park the Chevy half a mile away

I like to welcome y'all to the 'Go
But let me warn you
Before I take you on this trip
Keep your mothafuckin head straight
And your bitch better not have no purse
Let's go
Oh so pumpis now laid back may back and the top is down
They use to say that I was a awkward child
Made it hard for my pops to smile
'Cause I was blocked by
What you know about the city lights, top down blow tree
Feel the breeze throught the city night
The 23s got me sittin right
The Cartier's on my sleeve, Frankie Bs got em fittin tight
We quick to get up when it bust down
But see its G's round here so nigga please do not fuck round
This for my niggas up in Bucktown, you know the business
Every fifteen minutes you gotta duck down
We send it up then we slide out
But if a nigga wanna fuck wit my nigga we finna grime out
I tryin to tell you what the Chi about
'Cause ain't no city like my city
We be ridin rollin rollin ridin it crazy
We smoking sippin sippin smokin baby
We be ridin smokin sippin pimpin baby
I know you feelin me now
This is how we do it in Chi-c-a-go
And we dont kick it on the late no more
Ain't no parties in the hood, we dont skate no more
See err'body wanna chase the dough, I sip Bacardi
With a shot of strawberries so i taste the dro
I lay back and then I blow the haze
One for my niggas who were here before but are gone today
Dumpin out liquor, takin shots to make it go away
Down on my note ready to go 'cause I don't wanna stay
I'm on my way and i hope somebody call me back
Or maybe i do it for my nigga, G, baller, scrapper
'Cause when you look up in the sky you know he smiling at ya
This windy city got that Reaper steady coming at ya
But that's a common factor, we set it up and then we slide out
'Cause if a nigga wanna fuck with my nigga we finna grime out 'Cause ain't no city like my city, you either with me or ride out
We be ridin rollin rollin ridin it crazy
We smoking sippin sippin smokin baby
We be ridin smokin sippin pimpin baby
I know you feelin me now
This is how we do it in Chi-c-a-go
And i remember rappin in staircases clappin them 12 gauges
Stackin them big faces praying to god i made it
My life is so funny mo drama mo money
So now they see me off that remy gettin so scumm
Reproduction, most of my niggas facin life or they on they way
Depending on what  I'm makin
So now you see yourself real baby girl
And I hope you ain't trying to bring it here baby girl
'Cause uh, this ain't my occupation, this just a fuckin hobby
Half of y'all bitches waited on my album just to copy
But you sloppy and your verses will never top me
A real lyricist and you bitches is carbon-copy
Now producers wanna give me the boot
'Cause they know I spit the truth
And I can fuck they bitches up in the booth
But they still see me lettin it loose
See i make em feel the juice like a hundred-proof
And the hook goes
We be ridin rollin rollin ridin it crazy
We smoking sippin sippin smokin baby
We be ridin smokin sippin pimpin baby
I know you feelin me now

1 ContributorSo Real So Right LyricsVerse 1
Papi just let me say oohh, I got a feeling in my back bone
Grinding my body, can I get it with the track on
Ah shit he got the fitted with the black on, black looking killer, by the way thats how I like em
Its a party in the hood and they say its tight, and that head right, bet we there every night
I got my fitted on (check)
Got my dickies (check)
Got my itchy for them niggas tryna get me home (check)
Got my butter right, got the hummer tied (check)
Got that lumber to jump up and take another flight (check)
So what you wanna do, it could be me or you
Or we could play like nothing popping and just keep it cool
We went from hardly speaking, and hardly sleeping, im oddly thinking that he got my body reaching
For places that I never seen before, and by the way I got something for you to see me boy
Chorus
So real so right, wanna get with you tonight, I wanna feel good, feel right, making love to you all night, shawty so fly, baby you stay on my mind, wanna get with you tonight, ritee
Verse 2
Im getting drunk with my bitches, and then he hit me up
He wanna know whats the business, can he come and pick me up
Im looking good as hell and got a babysitter
I see you later yall, im crazy bout this nigga
And dey it ain't really feeling him, yo they be really killing him, illing him, and grilling him
But yo Im silly digging him
And I be going so on and on and, cause he keep me moaning from night to morning
Calling your phone when im knowing you ain't home, sorry
But baby I dont wanna be alone shawty, get at me just as soon as you get in
Pumping janet in the background and im sipping hen
With some nice little something with straps on my legs
Can you blind fold, tie me to the strap on the bed, let my legs spread stretch em to the back of my head, is you playing boy maybe you forgot what I said, can you dig?
Chorus
So real so right, wanna get with you tonight, I wanna feel good, feel right, making love to you all night, shawty so fly, baby you stay on my mind, wanna get with you tonight, ritee
Verse 3
And everytime I see, I wanna be all up on him, and I want him all up in me
And when I move through the city, I want him rolling with me
I can't explain how he feel and how his body fit me
We stick together whatever like its bobby and whitney, thats through the thick and thin
Soaking and stick it in, joking and kicking it, smoking and stick it --, I swear to god though
I been feeling shawty from the start though, fuck around and got me for my heart though
But im good with it, cause he keep it hood with it, and he ain't afraid to beat it up like he should with it, got the chevy pulled in it, and I love when we ride, throw them thangs up shawty, put yo guns in the sky, I be down for my nigga like im down for my team, stay around for my nigga
While he down for the beam, we just keep it trill, we dont need no child or no ring, for the time being , got me going wild on some things naa mean

This another street heat-BANGER!
Look how she wobble with it! (4x)
Now won't you shake with it! (4x) 
Look how she roll with it, shawty cold with it
Shawty make you wanna get out on the floor with it!
I ain't a dyke, bitch, but if I might, bitch
I got the money that could take you home tonight, bitch!
Now all the hoes get down on the floor
And we gon' throw this money 'til they say it's time to go
I'm sippin' on Ciroc, I'm blowin' in the dro
I'm standin' on the speaker like I'm finna do a show!
Look at it on her, the one right there
She climbed on the pole, she froze in the air
She . dropped into a split
I'm lookin' like ""Damn, she the shit!""
Shawty don't quit, she all about the money
She bouncin' through the club like the Energizer Bunny
She pop-pop-poppin' that pussy, call her Popper
'Cause when she get to rollin',  can't stop her!
Damn, ho!  Oh, it's you again
Go show them muhfuckas how to do it, then!
Shake your right cheek, shake your left cheek
They made it rain, now she wetter than a jet-ski!
Now watch her d-d-do it, do it, do it like a pro
She walked around the pole, put the pussy on the floor
She laid on her back, her legs in the air
'Cause she ain't got a bra or no underwear!
Shawty don't care, she all about the paper
She keep takin' shots to the dome, no chaser
She whip-whip-whippin' that pussy, call her Whipper
And if she keep twerkin' while she work it, I'mma tip her!
A stone-cold stripper, a whole lotta ass
She workin' on the pole, got a floor full of cash
Them other hoes mad, but go on, make 'em sick
'Cause you be gettin' money, and they be gettin' dick, trick!

I'm fucked up again
And I think I'm finna throw my guts up again, but I can't move
'Cause I'm stuck off the Gin and the Henn and Bacardi
And Remy, let's hit the party, it's in me
And I still got a fifth of sommo whiskey
Tipsy, feelin' real shiesty and risky
Bangin' a bitch if she wanna get frisky
Niggas wanna get up on the fifth, let's go
Niggas wanna get up on a O, let's roll
Niggas got da 50s of da dro and they swole
Put it in da Swisher finna smoke it like whoa
Don't understand me, I don't want a Grammy
Just hand me a hand full of goddamn whammy
Fluffed out and fancy packed where dat Yancy
Now I ride bumpin' How High in da Camry, whoa!
Dude, I stay so high
I can't stop drinkin', I feel like a fool. Am I losin' my mind?
Baby Bubba, I'm dude, I stay so high
I can't stop drinkin', I feel like a fool. Am I losin' my mind?
Ain't gon front like I don't smoke huff
That's prob' why a muhfucka throat so rough
I drink dark liquor, so I think I'm tough
A lot of scared niggas didn't think I bust
Midwest niggas do it minked out plush
Six piece wings wit the fruit punch crush
Project niggas from the hundreds to the low
151 got my stomach on the flo'
Matter fact y'all can't fuck wit da 'Go
Kanye with the hot track, Shawn with the flow
Most of y'all bitches can't top what cha ya know
Signed after 16 bars through the door
So act like ya know bitch smackin' dem hoes
Smokin' a sack, packed in a Tahoe
Kids in da back, swig in my lap
Cops on my track, so I hid me a strap, I'm gone
Dude, I stay so high
I can't stop drinkin', I feel like a fool. Am I losin' my mind?
Baby Bubba, I'm dude, I stay so high
I can't stop drinkin', I feel like a fool. Am I losin' my mind?
It's Missy and ya know dat, locate me like a Lojack
I'm on ya back like a nap sack
And when I rhyme you betta go back
To da lab goddamn man I'm tighter than a wavecap
Nah muthafucka can I say that
When I'm bouncin' on dem 24 babies
They be goin like wa wa wa wa wa wa man
I be fuckin' yo man, and
I already done did dat, y'all chicks betta sit back and relax
Now listen up fa the feedback
Me and Shawnna in da H2 Hummer gettin' tan for the summer
I talk real breezy, whack bitches y'all greedy
And if ya don't write ya rhymes then easy

Never 'bout that gutta but the mentality stuck wit her
Fuckin wit that butta and thats ok, nobody fuck wit her
Let me take you back to how it all kicked off
I was rollin wit my niggas then we took a long dip off
I was blowin swishes in the backseat and pourin liquor
And i wasn't really thinkin bout it
I was gone of course
Then we pulled on dark street (get out) he told me get out
Knocked on the door gave me the coke and said dont open ya mouth
I played it cool and didn't move til he gave me the cue
But on the real deep down inside a bitch ain't know what to do
He walked this nigga to the back left me alone in his room
A couple minutes now im thinkin what we on is it cool
Im thinkin i should see whats happenin' lets get on with this move
But then my nigga ran up on me cooly holdin his tool
Like lets get little hold the pistol and the paper lets go
And when we get back to the hood dont think nobody should know
And if you tell a motherfucka i'ma come for ya throat
But if you stay a down bitch I'll keep you comfortable
Now what the fuck im 'pose to do this nigga family to me
Lockin the game up by the blocks and papi hand me the key
Bandana on my hand and clamped on the hammer to squeeze
Was just a child im livin wild this nigga fouler than me
Livin in hell these niggas burn to a thousand degrees
Im drownin out sick from the germs in the bowls of the beast
Just when i get down to my last this nigga hit me in code
Get to the bus don't bring no bag, lets get this money lets go

You know where them killaz get right and rock a party
From Friday to Saturday night
Fifth of Remy I'm scum and I still hold the mic
I tried to put it down, and say that I'm cool
But they give it back to me and say continue
Thats the thing about the hundreds they never give up
On the drugs and the music and all that hood stuff
That makes ya life worth hustling for

Now kick this one here for me and my city
Yo I was chilling in the 50, minding my own
When this broad walked up with a chrome microphone
She said ""hey bitch look up, I heard about you
So heres the microphone let's see what you can do""
So I took the microphone, and I threw it to the bar
Cause I need no assist when it comes to going hard
When I start to rap, she start to shake
She saw that confronting me was truly a mistake
So she picked the mircophone up, and I took me a shot
And before I turned around that bitch was down the block, Now
Kick this one for Altgeld
Kick this one for the low end
Now kick this one here for me and my city
Now when I'm on stage, everyone starts choking
Is it what I'm saying, or is it what I'm smoking?
50-50 chance is what I'm blowin
And at the same time DTP got 'em open
If you can get hype, and sort of like loud

These are my ghetto fairytales
Sit back and just listen to what I'm spittin' cause I'm cold
I'm straight reminiscing on all my niggas dead and gone
See when I was young I was just so dumb and didn't know
How quickly the reaper would come and creap up for your soul
I play with them niggas that like to live it by the chase
They told me whatever you do just keep your body safe
Pitbull in the front and my german shepard by the gates
Blowing blunts of that broccoli to keep my body out of space
And I heard bout my nigga they send up to their face
And they sayin' it's probable when the feds investigate
Gotta do what I gotta do while they take my nigga away
Promised you my protection I gotta make a nigga pay
Bustin' in the direction of any mothafucka fake
I burn a nigga to residue, residents up in this place
Now they tell me I'm too ghetto for this shit
I feel like I'm the only rebel in this shit
 These are my ghetto fairytales
These are the tales, my ghetto tales
These are the tales, that I tell so well
Northside, Eastside, Westside, Southside
 These are my ghetto fairytales...
Commin' to you live and direct, with revolutionary respect
Keep ya' heads up, eyes open, fists clenched and dig this...
These are the sentences of those that exist
And the condition of the breedin' resistance
Na fuck the formalities for this is rated R for reality
It is what it is and I'm a give it to you the only way I know how to give it
Ain't no second takes or commercial breaks
Where they got us at right now-life lines bend that of love and hate
They talkin' 'bout terrorism-shit...
In our streets it seems that realities of every day is september 11
Being that our lives don't make the headlines
And we never get a correct account of
How many of us they be lockin' up and body baggin' up
We have been given the Voice of the Voices
Now it's gettin back to the point where
On a daily basis we pourin out a lil liqour for the ghetto live-ations
Buy these should be our told testomonies and our safe stories
That other cats won't even speak about
Now, our pain don't never go away
And our teachers don't even want us to know about our real leaders
While we suffer they want somebody else speakin' for us
And while we struggle they want somebody else profiting off of us
Seem like every time we go to the grave somebody gettin paid
This a new age of dealin with plantations
In other words; ghetto translation;
We gotta all ghetto  and those that represent the real
Now it's only right that those that live this shit and feel this shit
Be the ones to reveal this shit

Oh, oh, oh

I'll show you how to do this homie
With a bucket coach bag and a couple of bums
That's the bitch Def Jam got, second to none
And a god damn shame, but your record is dumb
Oh, be easy, Shawnna stay greasy
? act breezy, pop the four-feezy
Got the game queasy, my flow just sick
In that H2 hummer, nigga know that bitch
I'm hood like a fifty-pack of that fuzzy
See me whippin' through your city, in that ? Benz buggy
Armani Exchange on my skully
Now I'm walkin' from the bar sayin'
""Yeah nigga, buy it for me""
We in the V.I.P. high on scummy

Free Remy!
(Word)
You know what? Free Remy!
Fuck you, Free Remy!
(Fuck Nicki Minaj!)
Are you dumb?
You wore a pink diamond chicken wing chain (Are you dumb?)
You had a leopard beehive on your head (Are you dumb?)
(Fuck Nicki Minaj!)
Are you forgettin' that I pressed you before, bitch?
(Fuck Nicki Minaj!)
(I) Fuck with your soul like shETHER
(Will) You ain't the queen, I'll show you
(Not) Lipo your ass and belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already
They told you your whole career
I'd come home and kill you, right? Ha-ha!
I told you I wasn't talkin' about your dumb-ass
It looks stupid, you literally got a dumb ass
Talkin' cray, and we all know that you dumb as
You get Donkey of the Day, yeah, you dumb ass
Let's be honest, you stole that line 'bout bitches bein' your sons
How you take my '09 jail tweet and run?
Talkin' about bringin' knives to a fight with guns
When the only shot you ever took was in your buns
And I saw Meek at All-Star, he told me your ass dropped
He couldn't fuck you for three months because your ass dropped
Now I don't think y'all understand how bad her ass got
The implants that she had put in her ass popped
I was like, ""Damn, 90 days and you couldn't have box?
Did she at least compensate? Start givin' you mad top?
Her name Minaj, right? She ain't throw you some bad thots?""
He said ""Nah,"" that's when I knew you was really a trash bop
You was screamin' ""Free Remy!"" when I was upstate doomed
But now that they freed Remy you don't sing the same tune
Locked me up, threw away my keys, threw away my weaves
Snatched me from my son, braids to the back, state greens
Daily News, ""Her career's over,"" ""She was kinda stupid,""
But you saw a opportunity 'cause you a opportunist
Left your Day 1 'cause you heard he was on some cheat shit
Then got with the dude that told you on some creep shit
But what happened to Omeeka? Nah, on some G shit
Left him and took a pic with the dude he had beef with?
And we all know it was a beef that you started
Pillow-talkin' out of your ass, this bitch retarded
Now you gotta die, you dearly departed
Bloodbath when I catch you, a real red carpet
Now what I'ma do, I'ma just stick to the facts
Bitch so scared of my future, got this bitch goin' backwards
Been through mad crews, you disloyal hoochie
Now all of a sudden you back with Drake and Tunechi?
After he said you sucked his dick, you back with Gucci?
Who next: Puff, Deb or Fendi? You a A-list groupie
And to be the Queen of Rap, you gotta actually rap
The whole industry know that your shit is a wrap
No, to be the Queen of Rap, you can't have a ghostwriter
And that's why this is my house; Flo Rida
Niggas done seen Drake pennin', Wayne pennin'
And since your first boyfriend left, bitch ain't winnin'
You a Internet troll, a Web browser, I'm sorry
You can't get a on line without Safaree
Mentionin' guns, you Pussy Galore, James Bond
Only time you touch a trigga is when you fucked Trey Songz
Coke head, you cheated on your man with Ebro
I might leak the footage of you sniffin' them ski slopes
They gassin' you up, but you been on E, though
""Pills and Potions,"" yep, you been on E, ho
Got your ghostwriters back, so you think you lit
Rem Belushi, I'm a Ghostbuster, bitch
I'm supposed to be scared
'Cause you bought your Barbie chain back?
I'll revert to ""Ante Up,"" you'll get your Barbie chain yapped
Tried to front in February, catch you in that Maybach
Show you how to use your name, you be usin' your name wack
I'm sayin', how you mix Nicki with a Minaj?
I'ma park this bitch, put Nicki in the garage
I'm gettin' money like Nicky Barnes, I'm the big homie
I responded in less than 48 Hours; Nick Nolte
Gettin' close like Nick Jonas, grippin' the gauge
Then blaze off, Face Off, bitch, Nicolas Cage
You animated like Nickelodeon, you fake, bitch
Only the kids believe in you; you St. Nick
Now when I shoot Nick at Nite, they won't understand it
I'm Wild'n Out, 'bout to hit Nick with the Cannon
How are you on the VMAs, actin' like you hood?
Way across the stage, talkin' about ""Miley, what's good?""
That's Hannah Montana, she was always happy
You only fronted on Mariah 'cause Mariah don't carry
Tried to disrespect Taylor 'cause Taylor wasn't Swift enough
Pillsbury Doughgirl; Remy pick the biscuit up
I'm jealous? Bitch, you was happy when they took me
Best thing that ever happened to you was when they booked me
You said you never fucked Wayne – how stupid I look, B?
Get the picture, I'll expose you, I'm kind of a bully
You named yourself Nicki Lewinsky, the mind of a rookie
'Cause you was suckin' his dick and now he tired of your nookie
You claimed you never fucked Drake
Now that's where you took me
You fucked the whole Empire – who you tryin' to be, Cookie?
Boogie Down Bronx, I come out of the Boogie
To let you know real bitches never lie on their pussy
And stop talkin' numbers, you signed a 360 deal
Through Young Money, through Cash Money, through Republic
Which means your money go through five niggas before you touch it
Any videos, promotions come out of your budget
Endorsements, tour and merchandise, they finger-fuck it
You make, like, 35 cents off of each ducat
I own my masters, bitch, independent
So for every sale I do, you gotta do like ten
Stop comparin' yourself to Jay, you not like him
You a motherfuckin' worker, not a boss like Rem
You're done, them pop chicks ain't get the news yet
Bitch, I pop chicks, yeah, and I'm the new vet
I kill rappers, and you good as dead, bitch
Talkin' shit about me to a deaf bitch
And usually I have sympathy for the impaired
But not when you hard of hearin' from untreated gonorrhea
But you point your fingers at me? I’m the bad girl
When she the one out here misleadin' the black girls?
All these fake-asses influenced by that girl
Dyin' from botched surgeries – what a sad world!
But before the butt job, you was a Spongebob
Suckin' cock for records, captain of the cum squad
And I got a few words for the moms of the young Barbz
Guess who supports a child molester? Nicki Minaj
You paid for your brother’s wedding? That’s hella foul
How you spendin' money to support a pedophile?
He a walkin' dead man, sendin' threats to him
I guess that’s why they call you Barbie, you was next to Ken
Talkin’ about your money long and your foreign sick
Why you ain’t help your bro hide his cum from forensics?
You probably somewhere overseas, foreign sick
Thought you could fuck with me, by far Rem sick
Meek, Drake, Safaree, I see men in your pants
We call that Jelani, get it? Semen in your pants
Uh, I got trigger fingers, you got bitter fingers
Yeah, you must think you Drake and I'm Twitter fingers
VH1, watch this
You just got bodied by a Love & Hip-Hop bitch
Don't ever in your fuckin' life play with me
That's on the set!
You tried it on the Rae Sremmurd record
You tried it on your little freestyle
They was both duds, just like every other one was duds
Just like this last one was a dud
But what you not gonna do is keep subbin' me
Big… Pun!
I send a fuckin' headshot, you dead, bitch!

I'm a savage, I be killin' dead bitches
I bet you wish that you ain't never said shit
Now they so busy shootin' videos and I'm like nah
Where the fuck is your song? I mean, come on
You know the pub want some bars, I'm Remy Ma-
-Rgarito, I ain't sparrin' with you bozos
My raps too hard and you Miguel Cotto, uh
I swear to God, this chick a real fraud
Bet you wonderin' how I know your problems?
It's a lot of people that you really bothered
They was sellin' footage and you know I bought it
This ain't a little L, wait, wait
You took a Big L, you diggin' in the crates, yeah
I put you on the bench, you really press
She was absent, an automatic F
Waited four days, ma,  where you been?
I came here in the 'Rari playin' Lil' Kim
Don't know what made you think that you could fuck with Rem
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make ya spit
Already took a L, now you got another one
I secure the bag, now I got another one

Heard you was kiddin', sayin' I ain't havin' none
But that's okay baby, 'cause now you my son
They like, ""Yo, Rem go in again""
My flow cold, her ink froze in the pen
You gotta go, you gotta go, lil hoe
I kick a dead horse till it don't move
Don't come around me, now I got the crown, see
I beat you with punches in 48, you Ronda Rousey
The wigs and nose, you a whole clown, B
I better not ever hear you say anything about me
I came from behind bars like a bottle girl
No candy bars, I raise the bar, I'm like a bodybuild
All blue Maserati, sawed-off lil shottie
Put blood in your head, leave your whole damn head red, Lil Yachty
Oh, and if you doubt that, you can catch me outside, bitch, how bout that?
When it's dark and hell is hot, I'll DM your ex
Sittin' here now like, ""Who I'ma DM next?""
I handle these bars like a BMX, Grrr
Get at me dog, DMX
And I'm waitin' for a bitch to talk outta her neck
'Cause we got pictures, we got videos, and we got texts

I'm happy, another me there never can be
See, I'm so outstanding
Don't care if they can't stand me
I'm sittin' on top of the world like Brandy (Sittin' on top the world)
See, I look too good for this necklace
And I look too good to be wearin' this
You know I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See, I look too good to be drivin' that
And I look too good to be buyin' that
You know I look way too good to be tryin' that
I'm conceited, I got a reason
Now, who's that peekin' in my window?
Nobody 'cause I live in a penthouse
Baby, I'm sorry but I'm sexy
And all I want you to do is just bless me, let's see
This kid that I'm waitin' on
He said he love when my jeans look painted on
With a tight white tee, you ain't quite like me
Probably why I'm always gettin' hated on
Now, shorty tryna push up on me like a Wonderbra
Listen when I speak, I wouldn't want you to take it wrong
Now, number one, I don't need you
Your name's Q, I only see ""U"" when I see you
Listen, two, you could never play me (Why’s that? Why’s that?)
'Cause I'm such a fuckin' lady
Three, it's all about me
I don't wanna talk about it
If you'd like to hear it, here it go
I wrote a song about it
See, I look too good to be fuckin' you
And I look too good to be lovin' you
You know I look way too good to be stuck with you
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See, I look too good to be gettin' with
And I look too good to be havin' kids
You know I look way too good to be in a crib
I'm conceited, I got a reason
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don’t know what I'm doin'
I can't stop my body from movin'
I'm boppin' and poppin' to the music
He's watchin' me and he's about to lose it
I'm droppin' it hotter than the Dogg of the Snoop did
""Face Down, Ass Up,"" on some Luke shit
I'm outta control wit' it, dip it low, pick it up slow
Poke it out, now roll wit' it
My thong showin', but it's cool, my shoes go wit' it
Now all I need is a room wit' a pole in it
See, I look good and I'm knowin' it
But I was never too proud to be showin' it (Now)
See, I look too good for this necklace
And I look too good to be wearin' this
You know I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See, I look too good to be drivin' that
And I look too good to be buyin' that
You know I look way too good to be tryin' that
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See, I look too good to be fuckin' you
And I look too good to be lovin' you
You know I look way too good to be stuck with you
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See I look too good to be gettin' whipped
And I look too good to be havin' kids
You know I look way too good to be in a crib

Pretty brown eyes
You know!
Yeah, I got that up north glow, body lookin' like cinnamon

Fashion killer, Alaïa assassin
Vetements villain, Balenciaga bastard
Got that melanin magic, brown skin poppin' (Baby)
Always fly, I stay in a cockpit (Baby)

Open the door, then locked it
E'rytime Remy touch the city, stop it
You're my pretty brown eyes

I know they need you in they life
But you my vibe tonight and I love you, oh

Between your legs tonight is what I wanna do
I'm a real writer, rap crown taker
Ass so soft because it's not faker

He met me and now he don't even know bitches

35822,Remy Ma,Always,"One look in your eyes and there I see just what you mean to me
Realize that being single ain’t all what it seem to be
Been around the while and I see the scenery
But when I go to bed at night is you that I want sleep with me
Here in my heart I truly not for nothing do believe
I don’t need shelter, don’t need water, don’t need food to eat
I don’t need clothes, I don’t need sleep, I don’t need air to breathe
For me to live your love’s the only thing I ever need
And you ain’t never sleeping around right? (Right)
You never treat me like a clown right? (Right)
You ain’t never try to play me
You my daddy I’m your baby
I’m your queen I got the crown right? (Right)
But you gonna always be around right? (Right)
You gonna always help me down right? (Right)
You gonna always really love me
You won’t put no one above me
I’m your queen I got the crown right? (Right)
I look in your eyes there I see what happiness really means
The love we share together makes us sweet as jellybeans
Together forever yes 24 is you and me
Just call us after A ‘cause we will always be
This our love feels so right I know that it can’t be wrong
This how I feel inside nah this just ain’t a song
If they say infinity, I say that it is
They say they couldn’t be alright because we are still going strong
:
When I look in your eyes there I see all that love should really be
There’s no facade with us, you’re really you I’m really me
I need you more and more each day your going’s a vacancy
There’s nothing on this planet that can take you away from me
You’re forever mine, and I’m forever yours
They should have never said never we gonna weather the storm
We’re like that raven in that poem, we forever more
Our love got different meanings, we a metaphor",349,,neutral,0.000,"""[]""",0.500,"{""id"": ""7DkecC54tBK3qZBzN9SXOV"", ""name"": ""Always"", ""album"": {""name"": ""Im Around""}, ""artists"": [{""id"": ""39mHYiNmLR7p8PXNG8Wll6"", ""name"": ""Remy Ma""}], ""explicit"": true, ""popularity"": 4, ""duration_ms"": 162816, ""preview_url"": null, ""release_date"": ""2014-11-18"", ""external_urls"": {""spotify"": ""https://open.spotify.com/track/7DkecC54tBK3qZBzN9SXOV""}, ""migration_date"": ""2025-09-24T08:51:15.238696"", ""migrated_from_sqlite"": true}",1731,35,9.971428571428572,remy_ma,chill,general,0.500

Can I get a moment of silence please?

Dying to be me, dying to be me
Hair done, brows waxed
Lashes laced, lips MAC'd
Nails nice, toes match
My clothes from Bergdorf Goodman, shoes from Saks
Now the bag is dope, the jewels is crack
And I pulled up in the what-the-fuck-is-that?
And this pretty face really don't help
It's practically masturbation the way I'm feelin' myself
And I'm not alone, nah, the dudes be on me
I mean when I'm regular in my Abercrombies
Tank top, flip flops, no makeup, hardly
They still can tell I got a body-ody
I don't need no friends, I'm a one-bitch army

1 ContributorWhen I See Her LyricsRumored to be a diss to Lil Kim or Foxy Brown who Remy had a beef with before she was incarcerated.
January to December 12 months of the year
60 seconds in a minute it's a problem when I see her
7 days a week, alternate sides of the street
I'm a drag that bitch like the mothafuckin' beat
That's word to me I'ma smack her when I see her
You the type to be like ""I'ma ask her when I see her""
And still be scared to death, you walk past her when you see her
See I treat her like a check and straight cash her when I see her
I'm a leave her when I see her, casadia when I see her
""It's me bitches"" yea Swiss beater when I see her
See it's on when I see her, she a goner when I see her
Word is bond I'm on her, I'm a stomp her when I see her
I'm a put hands on her, I'm a snatch her when I see her
Like my lil' cousin Pat say trash her when I see her
These broads is garbage I be laughing when I see her
They be copping pleas like ""Rem what happened? "" when I see her
I don't question her when I see her, I address her when I see her
Wash her up and permanently press her when I see her
Apply pressure when I see her, disrespect her when I see her
This is chess but I'm a chin check her when I see her
I don't give a fuck yup! I'm a duff her when I see her
I swear to my mother I'm a snuff her when I see her
It's nothing when I see her, no it's something when I see her
That bitch best bets to start running when I see her
I dare her to talk back and start frontin when I see her
I just might snap and start gunnin when I see her
Now I'm a step to her like a grown woman when I see her
Naw, I'm lying ya'll already know I'm dumbing when I see her
Yeah I'm coming when I see her
See it's over when I see her
So don't act like I ain't never told ya'll when I see her
I'ma Ether her like Nas did Hova when I see her
And then come back like HOV, and take over when I see her
Ya'll could call me Diddy cause I ain't stopping when I see her
I ain't Lil Mama, but my lip gloss poppin' when I see her
She ain't rocking when I see her, cause I'm rollin' when I see her
I'm a have her whole fucking face swollen when I see her

Puff gave me mils off the blue flame
You niggas too jet, you too plain (what!)

35830,Remy Ma,Remy Ma & Papoose | Funk Flex | #Freestyle027,"Y'all had to listen to garbage, I know y'all glad remy back
Getting that paper, that bag
You're not bad, you're doing bad
Mad 'cause I'm not mad
Can't take you serious, period
You live in your mom's pad
Heard you was at the freestyle and you was way scared
Bitch I'm so secure I wrote this on the way here
Been killing kids while they nap, since daycare
I got this sewed up and on track like fake hair
When niggas ask me to spit, they know what I'm 'bout to do
When they ask you to spit, they wanna see what that mouth do
When I talk greasy, trust it ain't about you
I don't shade, I say names you don't want me to shout you
Every bar is a bar, bitch what you know 'bout that
They calling me bars bitch or Kit Kat
You get that, you broads never go hard on a rap
Okay, maybe once or twice but you ain't all of that
See your whole style, bitten
Pieces ain't hitting
When I said it was written, I was talking bout y'all bitches
Y'all trying to play chess, but why would I play you
When I could knock the whole fucking board off the table
See I been the difference I don't do the shit they do
When I'm around they quiet, I'm loud you bitches K2
Im straight remy no chase boo
And y'all a bunch of old birds, y'all just grey goose
I'm probably the only chick that make flex drop bombs
Got more punchlines than thirsty niggas at prom
I ain't gotta fraud for you, black love be how I live
Before I made it cool you was HOP positive
I put you on punishment, now I gotta beat yo ass
You like a disobedient teenager, you wanna be in the streets so bad
All this talk about my son and your son
I'm hot and your whole world revolve around me, bitch I am the sun
Wanted to be an icon, ended up like Akon
They finally let me out now I'm an XCON
Everybody ratting, I really need some d con
Told flex put the beat on, so I can go pecan
I showed hoes the way, I'm the light, I'm the beacon
Looking for that real bitch, I'm the one that y'all seek on
I'm on paper I'm over here blowing dank, y'all bitches really haters over there shooting blanks
But who knows, you might really hit something one day
But right now, your shit is weaker than Monday through Sunday
I'll take your wig off, no literally take your wig off
It's funny when she's talking tough, cause we know the bitch soft
And if she soft you sophomore
That's why I school freshmans and juniors, but let me tell y'all what for
Cause at 3 us, 2 can shoot the one
I'm 195 ten you little bitches is done
I got that face on pretty, attitude on savage
NEW York city I'm in the center like Javits
Now this the part where I talk shit, I know y'all hate that
This part not about bars, it's just all straight facts
In 2 years, no album, no solo single, no tour
3 million followers and got 2 BET awards
Got the album of the summer, independent and the shit popped
Legitimized an entire franchise of Love And Hip Hop
Ratings be Monday night, football to be toward thrice
Had Hov on my remix, deadass I am nice
Appointed black love, I made it cool to be cuffing
I body every beat I touch and then I married my husband
Brought NEW York rap back, rapping how I really rap
Bodied summer jam twice, what you know about that
Two Soul Train awards, yeah female rap changing it
And yesterday I woke up to two Grammy nominations, FACTS
Everybody on Instagram want to be a mannequin
Bunch of bitches, you should try to be a man again
I be movin' that white boy, Mac Miller
We both from Brooklyn, shoutout to that wizard
Niggas try to clap at me with fake goons
I'ma clap back, they gon' send me to the Shade Room
Just yesterday we was Obama'd up
Now we all stuck with Ronald McDonald Trump
Every time I spit a sixteen, I get the crowd hyped
Tell 'em the king back, they ain't wearin' my crown right
I be livin' that four pound life
That nigga Flex go and say ""Yeah, this what New York sound like""
Y'all was all happy to be at the AMAs
I was out in New York grippin' my favorite gauge
Satisfyin' some dope fiends, they ain't complain
Be shootin' up with a dope needle, we gave 'em AIDS
Before this rap shit, my family made a name
In the daily news, you fools, we made the page
These rappers act tough and cocky but they afraid
Boogie Down Productions run up and take the stage
I had a black and white TV, I made a change
Now we in living color my nigga, Damon Wayans
Public enemy number one, Flavor Flav
Oh
Yo
Uhh
Uhh
Hey yo, your Rollie be tick tockin'
That's 'cause it's not real, you be bullshit coppin'
I keep the fifth cockin'
I spit so much crack in this new jack city I got the fiends Chris Rockin'
One day you with this clique, y'all went shopping
Next day you with that clique, this shit shocking
Next day you mad at them both, you flip flopping
You hang around with too many cliques, you clique hopping
Get Biz on the mark, he just a friend
The cocaine so gray it need Just For Men
You pull a Tommy, I pull a nine
Squeeze you like an orange
Now your Tommy is dead, condolences to Martin Lawrence
While you was in the mirror trying to pop that bump
I was on the block learning how to pop that pump
Go ahead and gamble with your life, think you got that luck
You put your life in the bank, I'ma stock that up
You pay some change for your watch, man you not that tough
I'll ox that chump for a watch that much
Always talkin' 'bout the can, how they locked that up
Man, it is what it is, but it's not that tough
I'm saying jail is jail, it's the block that jump
That's where they kill, seen the top cats slump
I'm a walkin' reaper, spot I need to pop
Believe I got that skunk
I scheme and plot, I seen the block
I need to block that jump
You drink a lot but need to stop
To me you're not that drunk
You think you hot, you leap and hop
I swear your block that dump
The nina pop, the beam is hot
The beam will dot that punk
I dream a lot, I seen the nacirema, got that rush
A bunch of cock back guns, we the cock back bunch
I bring a Glock and keep it cocked to finger pop that cunt
'Cause niggas will scheme on you if you got their trust
It's the money if it's not that lust
And I ain't never scared never scared neither
You pop that jump and Brooklyn we pop you before you pop that trunk (Uhh)

I don't need a shooter, I'm the shooter
Come get me
Got a 9mm resting on my right kidney
This for everybody that was claiming that they miss me
My footwear crispy, flyer than a frisbee
Keep a Papermate and some college-rule with me
But can still come off the head, like a 59-fifty
Get that heroin from Houston, so I call it Whitney
It makes the fiends scream, so I call the fiends Sidney
Shoot at cha' crib, and I don't mean where ya live see
I mean the crib where ya motherfucking kids sleep
You a square like that ugly ass Benz jeep
I'm more hood than the Ku Klux Klan sheet
I'ma sit on the throne, since hoes can't stand me
Ain't leaving till they call to outs me 7 Grammy's
Can't nobody tell me, I don't does this
I need some Hammer pants, cuz can't no bitch touch this
Caught yall red handed, all yall bitches is busted
My flow sick, nauseous ,disgusting
My mic sounds nice, I just had to dust it
The rap game twisted, I'm here to adjust it
I know yall flustered ,Yall panties is bunching
Yall know Remy wrap hoes for breakfast, dinner, lunch
But, if yall play nice with me in the sandbox
I'll let yall pussies breathe
No need for Tampons
But if you wanna bleed ma welcome to JamRock
I just did six years, bitch I'm nice with a can top
All yall hoes coochi none of yall won't pop
Why yall was in Gucci, she was in gun shops
Get accidentally shot, she keep her gun cocked
She got so many sons bitch she need sunblock
Sunglasses, and UV protection
She come so hard, they should call it erection
Yeah, that girl dope this a lethal injection
She fucking with the kids they all getting molested
They say Rem is the best
These other bitches is cool
But, Rem ain't eat em up these other bitches is food
Just speak your price, she'll easily finish her
Shes so nice, she spit like Chris and em'
Chris ""KRS-One"", Christopher ""Big Pun""
Yes, Sheezus Christ, she'll just christen em
Bitches so thirsty, need for me to quenching em
They all washed up, so really she just rinsing em
Out in Beverly Hills, She be Fresh Prince'n em
Hoes don't exist to her, She don't even mention em
Bitches can't play with her, they coach is straight benching em
Tell them hoes hang it up, The girl is straight lynching em
They say I'm Project pretty, ghetto, high, siddity
And every hood chick wannabe like Remy
They say I walk and I talk like New York City
Ok, motherfucker so what's really?
These bitches ain't doing nothing, I gets busy
Cheap deck a ho can get smacked silly
But on the contrary , I packs the mack Milli
And believe when my gun pop, it's gone be a head shot
They locked me up, yeah they gave Rem a pen
But they fucked up when they gave Rem a pen
No studio, so I was holding them
But as soon as I got out
I started going fucking in bitch!

Let me thrill you with my song
Let me replace the love and the faith
Could it be you're falling in love
With a thug right now?
Could it be you're fallin' in love
With a thug's lifestyle?
Could it be you're falling in love
Right now, right now, right now?
Could it be, it can't be, Pun, I'm calling ya bluff
I must be high off this weed 'cause I ain't fallin' in love
All that I ever dreamed of was fucking a thug
So, I could bust a few sluggs and sell a little drugs
Be up in the Benz, chilling, rolling ya blunts
Have the Spanish mommies illing 'cause I'm sitting in front
And niggas on the block sick like, ""What you doing with that spic?""
Y'all don't know Puerto Ricans and blacks make the cutest kids?
Ya hair, my eyes, ya nose, and my lips
If it's a boy, hope that God bless him with his daddy's dick
Shit, to tell the truth, with you I know I'm safe
'Cause if another nigga fronting he'll get blown in his face
And I like that
You give me love and I give it right back
But when you flip don't you think I ain't gon' fight back
Pun, you got dough, but you know I got a nice stack
So when you mad, go ahead take ya ice back
I just throw on some lipstick and The Stylistics ""Break Up to Make Up""
And you know I hook a steak up
Take you breakfast in bed, nigga, soon as you wake up
Get my jewels back and take another trip to see Jacob
Lovin' the way I do this for you
And every kiss that I blew, Papi Chu, was a kiss for you
Stayed true, faithful, and you can never say I played you
'Cause you my boo and I can never say I hate you
Could it be you're falling in love
With a thug right now?
Could it be you're falling in love
With a thug's lifestyle?
Could it be you're falling in love
Right now, right now, right now?
I swept you off ya feet, you was just walking, crossing the street
Said, ""Was you talking to me or was it my boys in my jeep?""
She said ""Either or"", said she loved the way I play ball
Go after the bigger niggas even though they was twice as tall
Shooting dice in the hall inside of my doorway checking my drawers
Up North style right next to ma balls
Just the little things would impress her a lot
Like when I let her sit in my Lex' tryna guess where where the stash is
God blessed her with ass, she had the perfect mix
She thought morena was an Indian Twist
She had the cinnamon lips, match of rimmy and crisp
Thought she was Dominican the way she was swinging them hips
I never had a clue that she wanna ride for me
But like Donell, shorty had eyes for me
It's a quarter past one, but that's another song, what was wrong?
Why you took so long to put a brotha on?
It wasn't long before we start Bumping and Grinding
Crushing her spine and had her sounding like Busta was rhyming
Busting her hymen, the slightest touch when I bust had her crying
Her bus went by and she was already up in there ryding
Cussing and wilding, talkin' dirty in the back of the Porsche
Whose pussy is this?
Come on daddy, it's yours
Come on
Could it be you're falling in love
With a thug right now?
Could it be you're falling in love

I'm a one bitch army, y'all could hardly call me
So imagine when I team up with the Puerto Rican Barbie
It's gon' be armed, see, I'm so from the Bronx
Being all I really wanna see is blood on the concrete
Bodies in bags, and flowers on caskets
Corpses swarming wit' flies and maggots
Innocent girls and boys turn into bastards
I want bitches to die deaths that are tragic
And niggas, fucked in they ass, turned into faggots
They balls cut off and mailed to they parents
See, I don't give a fuck, I'm a motherfucking savage
Now, y'all tell me, what bitch is the baddest?
Miss Remy con la Queen, you need fire, tú sabes
Fuego está aquí
Vete pa'l carajo, nigga, far from me
No es dífícil pa' ver, it ain't hard to see
A four clip in the extra, yo soy la mierda
Tate quieta, this bitch got a bad temper
Respeta, puta, no pueda joder con nosotras
Un mierda

The girl is not to be fucked with
See, I don't give a fuck
There's not a pussy on this planet that can't be fucked
Bitches don't exist to me, they all cum faced sluts
How much room in your mouth for my name with all that dick you suck?
And your husband's a homo, he loves to get stuck
Like dildos and vibrators shoved in his butt
We ran trizz on his lips, and made him dress up
And I got it on tape, we straight fucking raped him
Don't get it confused, see, I hate male groupies
Pero he's willing, then I'm ready to take the opportunity
My bitches is the illest, so really, we don't gotta care
Vete pa' la mierda, nigga, get the fuck out of here
Yo no juego, nigga, I don't play
What I'm capable of, I don't know, yo no sé

Miss Ivy Queen, please, canta la coro

La isla del encanto, olando en canto
Y sacarle con su llanto, a sangre fria
Mis guilas tienen crías, jodedoras por si tú no lo sabías
Queen llega a escena, dan pena
Con las locas que van nebuleando
Yo soy de la calle, si me estás buscando
Ando con par de locos pa' verte brincando
So, no te ajores, no te desesperes mere
Yo tengo el control con las mujeres
Muchas me odian, otras me quieren

Don't give a fuck what y'all motherfuckers think of me
So fucking what, fuck a slut if she ain't feeling me
If you a real bitch, then you love my shit
Turn out the lights, get ya man and fuck to my shit
Ride that dick, make him eat yo shit
Bust ya nut ma, light a blunt to my shit
I think it's some truth to that sex sells shit
'Cause bitches is so pussy, niggas is just dicks (Shit)
I'm so sicking, don't think 'cause I smoke a lil' more
Than a lotta weed that I'm slipping
As long as hoes is still stripping, my flow is still flipping
Jewels'll keep dripping
And I'mma keep comin' through in that six wit the seats back shipment
Stop tripping, bitch, 'cause when I stop you looking
It's no need for the ice grill, you not in Brooklyn
Go 'head and act fool like you really wanna step to this
And I'mma put the tool right between ya two breasttess
And ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless
Young but I done did to too much shit
I smoke like an O a day
Nothing but the Dro and Haze
So, you know I feel no pain
Now I gotta go away

But I swear mothafuckers gon' hear the squad
Y'all betta fear the Prospect and Joe the God
Armageddon, Tony Sunshine and Remy Ma
About to take over the world already run the Bronx
And if it wasn't for P, we couldn't be
So bless his heart, bless his soul
Make he rest in peace
Can I get a lil' moment of silence, please?
I never let him see me stress
Don't never try to disrespect
Nigga, I eat, shit, sleep and breath TS

I don't think you understand son
You know how many clubs I'm banned from?
And I can care less, I'm so careless
I'm from the generation where we did shit because you dared us

But dont get it twisted bitch I'll still smack you
Your friend wanna act up?

Ok wanna play then them things can cop

And I just got started ain't about to stop
Admit it, the flow retarded and the girl is hot see if Remy Ma the best then i guess you not
See most chicks want a dude with a tool with a nice clip
Me I want a tool with a scope and a nice clip
You know a N1 or a AR15
Equipped with shell catchas night vision and end beams
Plus extra bullets for all the hatas
I keep it street like Styles and flow sick like Jada
If the squad was the Lox I guess I’d be Sheek, background like suck mah dick all over the beat
Walk with me

I ain't a rapper I dont rap
Think I was pink the way  they scared to catch eye contact
Bitch you ain't crazy
You don’t wanna get smacked call me miss vma
Bum bitch lean back
Lean back you don't want
What the fuck you can't be serious
And I can't be touched bitch period
I know you hearing it my name gotta heavy ring
I got them screaming ""damn Rem on everything""
Thats word to everything
You can catch me anyday anytime
Any hood bitch heavy bling
See that's gangsta

35848,Remy Ma,What’s Going On,"Why didn't I see the signs, I was to busy getting high
Running up the studio smoking dro writing rhymes
To blind to notice my abdomen was growing
Having sex without protection now my belly is showing
Nobody know that me and my boo trying to decide
What to do he buggin' like that's a little me inside of you
It ain't true and I'm scared and I can tell he is worried a bit
So we proceed to get the weed and straight ignoring the shit
My jeans don't want to fit every morning, hurling and shit
I had to tell my family, I knew they all was going to flip
And his was happy, thinking he was about to be a daddy
But I knew it wasn't true even though we both wanted it so badly
Tell me what's going, I know what I'm doing is wrong
Can you hear me, Lord
When I'm calling, forgive me, my baby
How am I supposed feel the situation is real
Never wanted to letcha go, baby
We'll meet again I know, baby
We love each other madly so much to gain so much to lose
I'm in pain your mind frame change when you the one that gotta
Choose talk a walk step in my shoes think in negative thoughts
Politics and shit quit when the doctor says positive it's a life living
In my body but it don't gotta to live it's up to me but if i keep what
The fuck I got to give I mean I'm still young and I don't really have
Shit and if this nigga up and leave then my child a be a bastard
This is drastic nobody really understands me and my mom don't
Give a fuck and neither does the rest of the family they like
""Remy you can't afford it, you expect us to support it?""
I feel my seeds apart of me and I don't want to abort it so
Tell me what's going, I know what I'm doing is wrong
Can you hear me, Lord
When I'm calling, forgive me, my baby
How am I supposed feel the situation is real
Never wanted to letcha go, baby
We'll meet again I know, baby
I'm not steady but I can get ready for responsibilities, shit
Where would I be if my moms got rid of me
I'm so stressed and i'm under a lot of pressure
But all i need is the remedy to make remy feel better
I knew, I couldn't win so I chose to forfeit, it's a shame
I'm over four months and i'm in the doctors office
I swear to all that I love that I wanted to leave and wait
Five more months and birth the child that I conceived
But I sat there because I felt I had to and I cry everyday
Because I realize boy or girl that I wanted to have you
Don't be made at me, how it is, is how it had to be?
And any pain I put you through is all coming back to me
Tell me what's going, I know what I'm doing is wrong
Can you hear me, Lord
When I'm calling, forgive me, my baby
How am I supposed feel the situation is real

It's been 3 weeks since the diss from Little Kim
The one you played it once , and never played it again
Remember when she told yall she was bout the Benjamins?
Yall act like yall ain't know that she wasn't writing then
To begin, how you think you really gone pretend
Like you got the crown and you nicer than Rem
Plus when, you had to get your stomach pumped from swallowin' them kids
If you did it then, then you'll probably do it again
Talkin' out your face saying you from Brooklyn
With a fake nose and fake tits
Now that was the sin that Kimberly end
It ain't my fault that the record didn't spin
You ain't gotta ask cause I'm nice with the pen, girlfriend
Lemme break it down for you again
You know if Rem you say it then its truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really just a gem
Babygirl Reminisce is really not the one
Your peoples lying to you and you believing em', see
Remy Ma is only human
You act like you ain't been through the same predicament

Yo, I'm a real bitch, these sluts ain't
Six years I did upstate
I did walks like I'm on a catwalk
These bitches walk like they butts stank
See my jewelry, you'll see rock
Like that imported vodka that Puff drink
Embrace the haters, I love hate
Cause y'all showing love, but that love fake
I'm from Castle Hill where they pump weight
The murder rate high and the drug rate
Them thugs love me, I got blood money
Cause I stash my money in a Blood bank
I been doing good, my son great
Y'all better have my ones straight
Hurry up, I don't fucking wait
I'll eat her food on my lunch break
Cuff me they uncover the truth
These hoes lie, yeah her too
Art of War, I'm Sun Tzu
I'm back bitch, don't know what to do
Your run was short like a (?)
Your hood where the ops live
Speed across the Ed Koch bridge
And pull up in front of that thot crib
I don't argue that's bum shit
My Mackage gets unzipped
Reach on you then dump clips
Punish her - that's Pun's shit
They all lost already
They don't want me to win
I'm 'bout to kill these hoes - Scott Peterson
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July

I want the white,  want a white, I want a white
Blue? Nah
That's just not right...
I want a white, droptop two door Benz
With a custom interior, 22 inch rims
I want auto parking, auto brakes
I want an automatic starter with a jet off take
I want satellite radio, internet, phone
Know I gotta talk to my nigga when I'm on the road
That's what I want, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want
Rem really rappin', these broads just yappin'
I press a chick quick like ""bitch what happened?""
I'll never see these hoes in the trap
And if you think I'm throwin' in subliminals, bitch catch
Got a gun charge cause I'm a lil' ratchet
And all you hoes dyin' to be me get a casket

They can't eat when I'm around, stomach's touchin' backs and
I'ma call it Remadan, yeah they fastin'
Y'all done signal lights just for flashin'
Ms. Martin in the Aston, yeah ask 'em
I'm laughin', and I don't want burgundy
Brown, blue or black, bitch

Their shit watery, get the fuck out of here
Niggas like ""Rem, please, you gotta drop quick""
I'm like, ""Easy, hoes can't even fuck with my old shit""
I'm talkin' rhymes that I spit six years ago
They still listenin', nah but y'all don't hear me though
These chicks comedy, yeah they Mike Epps
I'm a fucking horror movie and they're scared to death
Not for nothin', bitches frontin', they don't want me to come back
The fans is kinda smart and they can see that you dumb wack
My swag, tried to jack it, but couldn't quite catch it
Your flow is mediocre, your whole style plastic
This ain't just rap, bitch, I don't give a fuck

My shawties call me when they wanna get a brick
Cause even when I'm not spitting I'm still that bitch
In the the kitchen with that Pyrex Vision
And the way I chef up make you hang your connect up see
I guarantee to bring back extra
Take a buck thirty of white Make 200 hard and its butter
Plus 70 grand for Remy Ma
Oh god now that's a profit see I'm like a prophet
And see I'm a have all of my followers run through ya projects And smack the shit out of anybody
That's not on my dick
See they planned and plotted
But what they forgot is I'm a lunatic
A crazy ass bitch with not enough sense
But too much dollas
I pop the top right off of your fucking collar...
Young Rem, easy you know who I be nigga holla
I just copped a lil' crib in the secret location, laced it
Put a strip pole in the basement
Never keep the guns the same place where the safe is
Neva keep the funds the same place where the base is

Put a strip pole in the basement
Never keep the guns the same place where the safe is

Now that's word to grandma I'll cock the hammer
On the block and blow ya face off in front of the camera
And plug that hole with ya little bandana
And I still got my jewels like my name is Santana
Look lil' homie yall really don't know me
Looking for the squad but see I'm by my lonely bitches
Gon' pay like y'all motherfuckers owe me like Puff and Mase
Can't nobody hold me down from the boogy Bronx style with my hoodie
Got pounds of the brown right on the boulevard
Getting so down in that motherfucking tittie bar
Like fuck these bitches I'm tryna get pissy
And I'm not gay so fuck ya body-ody
Look around it's a sausage party
When I pull up in the pink Benz
With the powder pink Tims on 22 inches half black chink
Friends hop out with the pink tims
Laced with the mink trim platinum with the pink Jims
What y'all gon' think then? Bet you gon' love Rem
Y'all wanna fuck Rem
But y'all was saying, ""fuck Rem""
So now y'all just fucked up

Please believe me I'm hot no matter the season I spit
So sick the track be sneezing hook be coughing
Got the whole studio freezing if you hit me and I hit you
We still ain't even 'cause I'm not leaving 'til you stop
Breathing ain't nothing worst than getting popped for no reason
I wanna see shot laid out just leaking ya words
Can't come out cause ya mouth keep bleeding ya
Tanktop burgundy white tee burgundy
I know yall bitches wishing that them niggas would've murdered me

You know me if not you heard of me
The reason you gon' have to invest in plastic surgery

I'm on the road on promo tour
You in the hood fucking for free
Straight promo whore
Dildo in ya butt that should be your logo slore
I send you prostitute bitches on a porno tour
I had few exclusive spots but they ain't low no more
I heard you stopped by now I don't go no more
I send  40Cal shots through your Volvo door
Yo I rock more Chanel than that Coco girl
You coppin knock offs acting like its really a Gucci
I hops out the Porsche in Emilio Pucci
And walk up in the corner store and get me a loosie
And I don't even smoke just to shit on you groupies
And get a brown paper bag so I can sit on the stoop see
It don't more hood than your girl Rem truthfully
Like Keyshia and New Jack City the movie
Rock a bye baby you niggas is Pookie
And I got that crack
I don't know nothing about slow money
Grey base, pure white
Call me a snow bunny
You never fired a gun I keeps it so gully
My gun fire like Mike Saunders for  Payola Money
I'm conceited, Rem could never be ugly (Nope)
I take a Chinese chick ass before a face like Buffie's (Eww)
The rumors is crazy, I must really be that bitch
How could I have time to pipe Pap and y'all all on his dick? (Get off)
Picture me robbed by a washed up video chick
And how I'm arguing with Fox and she can't hear shit? (Ha)
Matter fact don't even ask me nothing 'bout nobody with a clit, a pussy, a ass, or some tits (Please)
I ain't gay, I can only tell you 'bout dick (True)
And that's word to the saliva in my mouth I spit that shit like none other
Fuck ya baby mother
We piped in the crib, I wipe my pussy with the baby covers (So)

And put it into the car, started it
Stepped on the gas, looked at the dash
95 really don't seem fast when you so fucking mad
And you so fucking high and you can't stop crying
Oh shit, I just ran a stop sign, fuck it
It's nothing, this nigga got me stressing
I can't believe he got me bugging now I'm driving wreckless
I can't even see and my high beams ain't really helping
But nobody really be using the streets before seven
Got the pedal to the metal like I lost my mind
And I ain't even see the school crossing sign
Car and the bastards, yeah, wind blowin in my hair
Seatbelt light's blinking but, I don't care
Somebody was crossing the street, came out of nowhere
Ran right into 'em, body flew in the air
Oh my God, my face already covered with tears
Saying my prayers, I ain't even seen her I swear
I stop out of reflex, saw blood everywhere
Mostly 'round the head of the little girl holding the teddy bear
I'm sorry, all I can hear is, ""I want my mommy"" (Mommy)
And then I ain't hear nothing from the little girl's body
I'm scared but I can't stop, what I'm gon' do?
The first thing the cop's gon' say is it was drug influenced
They ain't gon' understand what this nigga was doing
How he made me drive fast when I should been cruising
And they probably won't believe that it wasn't the weed
And shorty just popped up, in the middle of the street
And they really gon' be hating, this gun on my waist
And I checked shorty pulse and I don't think she gon' make it
Dial 9-1-1, or damn, should I run
I'm just weighing out my options before somebody come
If I stay I go to jail, if I run I'd be wrong
This is takin too long, fuck it, I'm gone

Oh, you a hothead, I'll leave your head hot
You know, I got lead when you see that red dot
And plus I'm dead nice, these bitches dead not
My chain Flinstone, bracelet bedrock
And when I'm not in Miami, it's hot like Miami
I got twin Glocks call 'em cotton and candy
I got cousins that get it poppin' named Tequila and Brandy
I spent like 10 thousand just shoppin' for panties
Know these bitches can't stand me, catch me hoppin' out that Cadi

Got the ghetto barbie but I got a lil' pop, pop

See I know how to rhyme and I'm nice on the mic
And I know how to ride 'cause I'm nice on them bikes
And not for nothin', I'm the type to wife
See I can cook and clean but I like to fight
I had this shawty like to bite I called 'em Iron Mike
Changed it to Jack Frost 'cause he started buyin' ice
If I'm lyin', I'm flyin', never catch me cryin'
You'd think I was down with the clipse the way I be grindin'
See a lot of chics is sick but I'm the sickest one
I got 99 problems but a dick ain't one
I got 99 guns and I still ain't done

35866,Remy Ma,Still,"Seems crazy cuz people be thinking that I be changing, but it's really them that be changing, yo
I remember the day, I first signed my record deal with Lyle everything was so good everyone was so proud
I was so very happy, still with my baby daddy
Living with my granny, but we was all family
It's like when the tour begin, that's when the war begin... you would be flipping, ripping soon as I'm walkin in
And I'm so sleepy, could barely stay awake, you don't understand I been in the studio for six weeks
Straight till 4 in the morning tryna finish these songs
And all you wanna talk about is how many times you was calling
And I'm always lying, it's never the truth it never crossed your mind that I could've been in the booth
Tryna hurry up and get back home to you, tryna get these checks so we could get out the 'jects
I wasn't thinking 'bout no niggas, wasn't thinking 'bout sex... tryna do this show so I could get this dough
All I was thinking was I gotta finish Remy on the rocks and I'm not tryna flop so it gotta be hot
Everybody on my back saying hurry up and drop so I'm asking you, what I'm suppose to do?
Listen y'all, I know it seem like I be dissing y'all
I'm just tryna reach my goals and remain focused but
Ain't shit changed, now, I'm still the same
So wish me well
Sometimes I might scream and yell
But even people with a fan base have bad days but
Ain't shit changed, for real, I'm still the same
Yo, You was the only child until I came
See we was buck wild back in the days
I was scared to have a boyfriend cuz you would beat him up
We'd eat cereal together, watch cartoons when we got up
So I couldn't believe that you flipped on me right in the streets for a bitch so weak that ain't got shit but
A fucked up weave and
I'm your blood, your little sister, I started to cry said it must be the liquor
See I almost died when you took sides with her then walked off and just left me there like I was nobody and you really ain't care
Said you would die for me, how you ain't gon' ride for me, how you see me on the block and don't say hi to me
It's all love now, and it's all done now, but you never took the time to apologize to me
It may be hard to see, but it bothers me... I know you ain't gon' let nobody do no harm to me
But you can't be acting like you fathered me... so I'm asking you, what I'm suppose to do?
Listen y'all, I know it seem like I be dissing y'all
I'm just tryna reach my goals and remain focused but
Ain't shit changed, now, I'm still the same
So wish me well
Sometimes I might scream and yell
But even people with a fan base have bad days but
Ain't shit changed, for real, I'm still the same
Mommy you was the one that made me but you didn't raise me
You left me all alone I had to hold my own
But now I'm all grown and far away from home
I know you love me but you did me wrong
I guess it was all the drugs that you was on or the beatings you got from my foul step pops
Remember the time his punk ass had his nerve to raise his hands to me bitch nigga blacking my eye
I was wishing he would die but now I wish him life
I know he seeing me blowing and it's killing him slowly but what kills me is that you watched him hit me, so I'm

Hand me my motherfucking Pelle Jacket

Do you
Consider me to be?
Tell me....
Wifey, Shorty, Bitches, Hoes
Wifey, Shorty, Bitches, Hoes
Wifey, Shorty, Bitches, Hoes
Which
One
Are you?
Now Wifey think she popular, she in the crib
Wifey out food shopping, she got the kids
Wifey doing the dishes, she folding clothes
See she don't care bout his Shorty or the Bitches and Hoes
'Cuz him and Wifey been with each other since they was younger
Wifey know shit like his social security number
When they get into a fight, Wifey call his mother
But what Wifey don't know is that its Shorty on the come up
Shorty the one he take to the barbeques in the summer
When Wifey get the voicemail, Shorty who he in front of
Yeah, he still love her but he love Shorty too
Plus the sex is so crazy and Shorty is so cool
Now he ain't even fucking Wifey, Wifey is old news
Wifey in the house crying, taking they kids to school
He don't answer the phone, Wifey calling niggas in the school
When he don't come home Wifey calling Shorty phone too
Now he mad, and wanna leave Wifey but it's reasons he need her
And yall know how the saying goes ""it's cheaper to keep her""
Wifey wanna leave but she scared to lose her status
Besides she rather suffer than to let Shorty have him
Now Shorty chilling, she sort of in the best position
Shorty got her own house and none of his children
Well at least none that's living, 'cuz Shorty stay in the clinics
He barely pipe Wifey so with Shorty he raw in it
Shorty she know his mother, his sisters and his brothers
And they all know not to mention Wifey when they in front of her
He with Wifey Christmas, but Shorty get gifts
And Shorty can't stand his Hoes and his Bitches
She knows he only sees them once in a blue
But feels she shouldn't have to put up with Wifey and them too
So Shorty getting mad, he gives her an excuse
Fuck her and eat her pussy and everything is like new",380,,confident,0.900,"""['success']""",0.700,"{""id"": ""2vSpukZ81Hw4sGp88va3ig"", ""name"": ""WSBH"", ""album"": {""name"": ""Im Around""}, ""artists"": [{""id"": ""39mHYiNmLR7p8PXNG8Wll6"", ""name"": ""Remy Ma""}], ""explicit"": true, ""popularity"": 3, ""duration_ms"": 195967, ""preview_url"": null, ""release_date"": ""2014-11-18"", ""external_urls"": {""spotify"": ""https://open.spotify.com/track/2vSpukZ81Hw4sGp88va3ig""}, ""migration_date"": ""2025-09-24T08:51:15.343098"", ""migrated_from_sqlite"": true}",1972,47,8.085106382978724,remy_ma,chill,success,0.700

Because I keep that ratchet, my mase, and my knife
And I don't pop pills but I will OD and
I'll pop that steel of a GP

Bet you take that bass out ya voice when I cave ya chest
Your 15 minutes of fame been came and left
And I just started bubbling yall bitches are in trouble man
One phone call and you finished cuz my squad stay on the double
Man we got cannons, handguns and toys that go blam-o-blam
I dont think ya mans and dem' understand that
When my boys get tight they'll pop like a rubberband
And you when you get shot its gone shock all ya other mans
Like when SDot brought in JL that SummerJam see

And you just be getting by looking for a handout
Stop Hummer stunting you frontin let the can hang out nigga

Mic check 1-2 , 1-2
In school I walked the halls with a sharp pencil
Now I'm drawing a pistol, let a nigga do a bitch move
Or let a bitch move I'm shitting
Wiping my ass with em like tissue
And then I gotta flush em see Remy really don't love em
Same shit different toilet, so like a plum I'd hate to plunge her
And If a nigga got some trees and a nice piece of lumber
And could make some paper than I might just fuck him
And If I stick em , than  I stuck em
Like a chicken I'll pluck em
Gave him some scrambled eggs
Now he walking so I duck him
Niggas got bubblegum blow
Pop broads like Rem some sorta sucker
Put some money on that bitch and I bet you I Lady Luck her
If she want a problem , cause a uproar or a ruckus
It's never nothing for me to quickly Timberland chuck her
Dead in the middle of ground zero
I'm like a Superhero, female Joe Pesci, Al Pacino modern day Robert De Niro
Defend my niggas that do murders like Robert Shapiro
Drink Malibu, pineapple juice and puff piff by the pillow
Forreal tho, Tell my flow ain't so crazy
Just shot at yo crib
Not where you live but where you lay yo baby
And lately I been spittin on some I'm real yo Conceited shit
To me chicks is like dicks
I'm quick to tell em beat it bitch
You hang around boxers, but your no tough cookie
You only get hard when your around pussies
I do chick greasy K Sleazy know my M.O
Why you runnin round like  please, please listen to my demo
I'm in a new MB bitch and I'm buggin at the windows
With the tints, limo black cause I'm blowing down the Indo
You may stunt round them other broads
But you don't want it with Rem tho
Take your posters down on some petty shit like my nigga N-O
I ain't saying that you garbage
You better stuck where you started
You could neva ever ever ever be Ms.Martin
I flow retarded, You can't stand to see me
I know you was wishing I was really banned from TV
That still wouldn't stop me from talking reckless on mixtapes, and CD's FM, XM, Satellite, and DVD
I'm remarkable it don't matter who I'm talking to
They all flow mediocre and they faces ain't marketable
Look ma you need more than some shades and some shiny lips
For me to believe you a rapper, and you really can spit
That you even next to me, Do yall hear this bitch?
I wish I was Foxy right now I don't wanna hear this shit
You need to fuck back, I know you been sneaking round back
You and your weave is loose I can see your tracks
You ain't fire , no bitch you ain't poppin
You a burning sanitation truck, ma you hot garbage
You a bum bitch, you hear the trumpets

I can punch you in your face, put the footage on Youtube

The Vuitton vixen, female Fendi

Yes I take cash , credit,  and personal checks
Oh yeah I'm a bastard
When I shop I ask the cashier if she want paper or plastic
Shesus Khryst tell me who's fucking with me
And if shes so nice tell that bitch to come and get me

Remy Ma allegedly shot a female sitting in a car. Remy Ma then got into an escalade and left the scene and crashed the SUV
Now Remy had a song in 2004 with the Terror Squad called Lean Back. Again police at that police station (inaudible)-  I cannot see my child again. Like do yall understand that I have shows overseas, like, please. Like, I'm supposed to be on my European tour right now

You see these old bitches they dont want it
They already know I gotta watch these young bitches
Tryna master the flow
You know the ones by the backdoor handing me a CD
Talking bout when they make it to the top they gone see me again
It ain't that I ain't impressed but I ain't pressed
See I don't listen to these bitches
But I ain't deaf and I ain't blind shorty must be outta her mind
I'm watching all yall motherfuckers, yea who the fuck want it?
And got everybody ducking bitch ain't CEO
Ands thats an acronym for better instead of them calling us hoes
And if you ain't coming with us , then you know you gotta go
I seen Young Jeezy and told him I got that snow (yeah)
I'm spitting like I'm still in the projects
22 forty-five apartment 9F
I never did Lean Back, and I ain't on yet
But in my mind I'm 18 and Pun ain't gone yet (check)
I'm banging on the table in the lunchroom
Crispy Jordans, matching Jansport, NorthFace snorkel
Recording in Q crib, using towels to soundproof it
Still battling the Blood bitches in Soundview
I'm smoking beef & broccoli in the lobby I be pollying
Niggas bringing niggas to the block so I can body em
Bitches really hating cuz they heard they husband hollering
But I don't give a fuck cause in the hood Remy like Rhodaman
Keep a heater, I'm a leader and I got some followers
Told em Ima take them from the projects to the promised land
And I ain't lying man you see I really mean it
The girl Rem's on fire I got these bitches heated
I'm undefeated and If these chicks is looking skinny
It's cause people heard of Remy and none of these bitches eating

I got the city in a frenzy
Everybody wanna know what it's really bout
Every ear waiting to hear whats gone come outta Remy mouth
I'm like a bad blood stain
Niggas can't get me out
I ain't no sidekick bitch
I ain't just flipping out
You tell me suck your dick
I ain't saying whip it out
I'm emptying the whole fucking clip in your zipper now
You can't reproduce anymore bastards or bitches now
I paid more dues than a college student
I'm just tryna reap what I sow like the farmers do it
And this shit ain't gone move itself,nigga I'ma move it
And send anybody tryna stop me to the trauma unit
(Fast) I ain't gotta prove my points
Cause all of them is hollow tip
I'm the Queen of New York, it ain't got shit to do with politics
I'm dead nice I dont know what to say no more
They like Rem why you dont come around the way no more?
I'm like cuz muhfuckas hate, I might have to break a jaw
It seem like the whole hood cooperating with the law
I'm riding dirty, license suspended like it ain't no more
Probably a car full of niggas that all spray that 4
Chicks see me like ""damn Rem don't fuck with bitches at all""
I don't fuck with bitches of course , cause bitches is whores (sluts)
It's not just the black girls all these bitches is lost
Puerto Rican , Asian, Caucasian, Dominican broads
But truthfully to me see, dudes is the worst
With ya half a hairline and ya dirty white shirt
How this nigga straight bird on his Nextel chirp?
Why would I walk past you and bump you
Talk past you and mumble
I could walk past you rush grab you and touch you
They movin indirect my Ave. is a jungle
But I approach him real calm, my swagger is humble
Like pardon me homie, I ain't tryna gather no trouble
But I'm actually puzzled
Why you keep crackin your knuckles?
These niggas is funny so I laugh and just chuckle
On my lap got the mac with the muzzle
It take business to move me, it take real women to soothe me
Wanna spend some time, won't spend it with poosey
That's the same reason I can't get with these groupies
My girl got more credit then the end of the movie
Bonafied killa, you spoken lie listener
Stop stealin my rhymes, yous a stolen line spitter
Take a flake by myself, holdin my liquor
These ugly ass rappers can't pose in my picture
Element of surpise, I don't notify niggas
I pulverize niggas
I went from A to Z, you could call me A-Z
Do or die nigga, drop notarized scriptures
They open eyes quicker
Grimy war in 94'
Unloading 9 gripper
Nine copper, nine fiver, gun totin, nine sixer
Son lockin, cut throats n' bust open yall niggas
2000 and 6 still holdin my trigger
Unfolded my temper
If you tell your fam, you wanna ride on his man

Then I gotta twist it in a Peach flavored Swisher Sweets. (Come on)

You know they bringing me goodies
Im puffin patio piff you blowing backyard boogies
Step in the place with my hoodie down
Pussies like to call cops
Never let em see my face
In case I have to send shots
Then we back up in the Benz, again, me and my friends and em
No we ain't hoes but we chiefin like we Indians
We be on that Kryptonite, you know we be gettin right
And all he wanna know, is can he take me to his crib tonight

Pun album number 14 like wha
Bout to take the whole industry like wha

We got the BX locked the
Mo less, T.S. has got me
No stress cause y'all can't stop me
A bitch like Rem is unstoppable

I wish every breath I take, could taste like 'dro
Every sentence that I say will come out in a flow
So I'll never have to write, or spend no dough on smoke
I was never a comedian, but y'all ho's a joke
I use to be the loud one, the only bitch in a bunch
Standin in the middle crowd, puffin a blunt
Like it's legal, never put the coke in my cut
Just shotties and dead bodies layin up in the trunk
Y'all ho's is drunk, you sound like her, you sound like him
But I don't really care, long as no one sound like Rem
Get into hot shit, y'all better stop shit
Now I'm only spittin, in a minute, I'ma haul spit
Make yo' record label take yo shit of the market
Take ya name off the roster, and write Remi Martin
I'ma a monster, to y'all fraud broads, I'ma probelm
I spit so sick, and I flip so quick like wha!

Once I get started, you can't do shit
But get pissed, cop the album, cassette, and compact disc
Put me in a mansion, still a project bitch
Party shit, come threw bombin shit
In a Benz tesseler, wit the darkest tips
So expensive, niggas hesitate to park the shit
Niggas got big funds, so we copped big guns
Y'all scared to death, since I got wit Big Pun
If I ain't the baddest Bicth, in this rappin shit
Tell me who the fuck is so I can slap the bitch
Tell her stop writin rhymes, memorize her lines
Get her own shit, she wastin my time
I'm a double don, none of y'all can't trouble mines
Make a remix, kill the same verse double time
Hot to death, fuck around and stop ya breath
The find ya hat, ya soul, and bloody the rest like wha!

They run around tellin cats they wanna battle me

Y'all know that my nigga's call me hannibal
Cause I be eatin bitches up like a cannibal
Wild out, like a muthafuckin animal

Yeah - started out on the good side
And shooked to the hood side
'Cause that's where all the crooks reside
And wherever there is crooks, there is crime
Wherever there is crime, there is cash
And wherever there is cash, there is eye
Anywhere is eye, there is my guys
The society of people that are all fly
Bolt niggas and bitches only dance for the ritches
Any place that I walk in, I make a grant interest
Classic image, you've got to admit it:
There is no one that can get all the attention from all of the women
But these hoes slow down, so I make 'em steady dissin'
Sayin' tryin' to figure out - well keep my clock tickin'
Walking into the office meeting with my watch hittin'
Not because I am scared of getting robbed
But I don't wanna be offensive to the executives in here
I got more money then 'em, and they supposed to be the ones with good jobs
High spitter then that nigga, I'm a hood star
83 cut dough - that's my favorite hood call
Corner park it up time that was my favorite hood walk
Pass me the chopper, I show you what it’s good for
 (x2)
Cash rules everything around me - C.r.e.a.m
Get the money - Dollar dollar bill, yoo
(Rem) x2
Cash rules everything around me
I heard motherfuckers telling niggas that they found me
But how is that possible when you ain't know where robby
? ya niggas hot - I tell ya stay the fuck from Remy
I be puffing purple, but sometimes I blow that brownie
Jay from Jamaica rolled in papers, smuggled in bouncy
I am 'bout to get money, bitch - dollar, dollar bill, yeah
I got a live crew that is dyin' to kill ya
Niggas feel my New York slang like they feel mob
Yeah, I mean, fuck outta here, son
That’s for ill ?
Go back to Hollywood ? that's where you got a chill guard
Never letting my nils ? I put that burner in your grill, Pa
Remy Ma, the queen of NY, she is so nice
A.k.a. the Bronx savior, Shesus Khryst
Whatever hater say - he or she don't like
May whatever they wish of me come back to them, Christ
Fuck your dead mother, bitch and your kid's a bastard
I am just here for Currensy, so tell me where the cash is
See - money controls all I seem: mass of confidence
Cash rules everything around me in other words
 (x4)
Cash rules everything around me - C.r.e.a.m

Yo this bitch can spit for hours
I'ma flip the script so these bitches can see who got the power
Plus I got the powder, niggas used to doubt her
Now they check the curb to see what I jumped out of
Yeah right now matter what my gear tight
Think my piece look sick you should see in the light
Sitting on my titties like, what the fuck nigga jump
Gotta Glock in the stash box , pump in the trunk
And I'll dump every single last fucking one these slugs
To the acid any motherfucking one of you bugs
Word to everything I love, I ain't tryna to be a thug
But I really will slap the shit out of one of you sluts
You a dolja , living in the next mans world
And I'm a soldier I'm like nigga get your girl
If the bitch disrespect me she getting slapped up
And your sideline niggas better back the fuck up
Listen up I spit this for Christopher
Rios and Wallace, and bitches can't stop this
Crazy can't no nigga try to play me
And instant, make it burn slower than an incense
Like fuck your demad whore, Fuck what you stand for
If you wasn't scared what the fuck yo ass ran for
You pussy and I knew it, these hoes is so stupid
You so old news and I'm so exclusive
You told me you respect me now tell em I'm the nicest
Gotta charge a fee my but sixteen's are priceless
You think you better lets battle for your ice bitch
Battle for your life bitch
And no offense but I can't stand a dyke bitch
See I really like dick
And I fucked your man and he told me that he liked it
How you like that bitch? Remy is that bitch
He bust twice bust twice
Why you click clackin'

Body gone sweep up on the shore of Manhattan
Not a problem to rob em' checks I cash it
Bitches so funny that's why I stay laughing
Keep letting em gas it, thinking you got it mastered
I'm not trying to take the spot I'm trying to pass it

Can't nobody do it like you do
Miraculous, phenomenal
And ain't nobody in here stoppin' you
Show no love 'cause you wassup
Look at yaself in the mirror like what the fuck
Damn, I look good
And can't nobody freak it like I could
Yeah, OK, I got a little fat, but
My shorty told me that he like it like that
I'm happy
Another me there never can be
See, I'm so outstandin'
Don't care if they can't stand me
I'm sittin' on top of the world like Brandy

Nobody 'cause I live in a penthouse
Baby, I'm sorry, but I'm sexy
And all I want you to do is just bless me, let's see
This kid that I'm waitin' on
He said he love when my jeans look painted on
Wit a tight white tee, you ain't quite like me
Probably why I'm always getting hated on
Now shorty trynna push up on me like a Wonderbra
Listen, when I speak out I wouldn't want you take it wrong
Now number one, I don't need you
Ya name's Q, I only see you when I see you
Listen two, you can never play me

'Cause I'm such a fuckin' lady
Three, it's all about me and I don't wanna talk about it

I wrote a song about it

And I look too good to be loving you

See, I look too good to be gettin' with
And I look too good to be havin' kids
You know I look way too good to be in the crib
I'm conceited. I got a reason
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't know what I'm doing
I can't stop, my body gone moving
I'm boppin' and poppin' to the music
He's watching me and he's about to lose it
I'm droppin' that hotta den drop it like its hot
Face down, ass up wit some new shit
I'm outta control wit it
Dip it low, pick it up slow, poke it out, now roll wit it
My thong showin', but it's cool, my shoes go wit it
Now all I need is a room wit a pole in it

No! Fuck you, free Cardi!
Period, purrd
Said lil -, you can't shoot with us, if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bullets, these is 22's
Hit the gun range, i can shoot 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut Onika off, so don't get comfortable (look)
I don't write my raps, that's what Cardi do (Cardi!)
Said i don't write my raps, that's what Bardi do
If I see you and throw a shot, that means i don't fuck with you
Two number 1's in in three months, yeah that's what payola do
Are you dumb bitch? 'Cause I'm not
Fuck with Remy, you get shot
You can't hang around my way, I keep my bullets in my Glock
I just checked out Cardi's bill, turns out she's rich, she's rich, she's rich
I put my gun above my hip, i bet you dip, she dip, he dip
Look, I might just shoot up young Nick, i might just pull out the stick
Y'all know that I'm filthy rich, and this song gon' be a hit
I don't mind you just a bit, I'm like Cardi B 'cause i quit a lick ('cause i quit a lick, lick)
(Mmm)
Had to let these felons know, just in case these hoes forgot
I'm the baddest inmate on parole since 1985 (five, 1985)
Ayy, i don't dance now, i make felon moves
Said i don't gotta dance, i make felon moves
If I see you and touch my gun, just know bullets is flying too

I hear yall talking but I know its not to me
To one of them , other bitches it got to be

They say I'm losing weight, I should probably eat
Well then feed me rappers or feed me beats
The term female rapper dont apply to me
I'm the Queen and this is chess they playing hide-n-seek
Like seriously where do these chicks be?

No feature , remix, or mixtape
Not even a guest appearance or
No DVD, I never seen you on the panel
No radio stations, no TV channels, no cable, satellite
No XM, even your Facebook page ain't got no friends

s My Name LyricsShe says she love my nature
She don't love me, she love my gangsta
She don't love me, she love my paper
Caught me creepin with the next door neighbor
It wasn't me (If it was, it was)
She'll still love me, cause love is love
He said he love my body
He don't love me, he love my punanny
I'm in love with the things that he buy me
Caught me with the next nigga in the lobby
It wasn't me, (If it was, it was)
He'll still love me, cause love is love
Now what's my name? (Daddy)
What's my name? (Daddy)
And I still love him even when I'm aggy
He has me wrapped around his finger
And in my cell phone, he got his own ringer
Now, sometimes he get heated
And I know he don't mean it
But as much as he accused me
I should have cheated
And even if I cheated, he wouldn't believe it
Cause right after I read it, messages gets deleted
And I know we even but, I don't never see it
When I step on the scene, the groupies gotta beat it
He caught, it's cool, but we break up
New bag, new shoes, and we make up
He buy me diamonds, that's my darling
Guess I really believe that he sorry
As far as I can see, he called for me
How could I not accept his apology
She says she love my nature
She don't love me, she love my gangsta
She don't love me, she love my paper
Caught me creepin with the next door neighbor
It wasn't me (If it was, it was)
She'll still love me, cause love is love
He said he love my body
He don't love me, he love my punanny
I'm in love with the things that he buy me
Caught me with the next nigga in the lobby
It wasn't me, (If it was, it was)
He'll still love me, cause love is love
Now what's my name? (Baby)
What's my name? (Baby)
And once I get it, I'm gone, I'm Swayze
I do the damn thang and I run
I knew she was a freak, cause she had an earring in her tongue
Cop a whip, I cop rims, I'm not those dudes
How you gonna buy a suit and don't cop no shoes
Put the sugarfoot inside her stomach
Man I have her climbing up the wall like Spider-Woman
She gon' ride through the hood on back of the motorcycle
Sexy, she got more thighs than the Bible
Can't tell a woman you love her, are you stupid?
Words don't express your love, you gotta prove it
A man give you his trust, you can't abuse it
Annalyze your choice before you choosin'
Ask Snoop Dogg, I let it bang
I got the hardest chick in the game screaming my name
She says she love my nature
She don't love me, she love my gangsta
She don't love me, she love my paper

Can't nobody do it like you do
Miraculous, phenomenal
And ain't nobody in here stoppin' you
Show no love 'cause you wassup
Look at yaself in the mirror like what the
Damn, I look good
And can't nobody freak it like I could
Yeah, OK, I got a little fat, but
My shorty told me that he like it like that
I'm happy
Another me there never can be
See, I'm so outstandin'
Don't care if they can't stand me
I'm sittin' on top of the world like Brandy
See, I look too good for this necklace
And I look too good to be wearing this
You know I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited. I got a reason
See, I look way too good to be driving that
And I look too good to be buying that
You know I look way too good to be trying that
I'm conceited. I got a reason
Now who's that peaking in my window?
Nobody 'cause I live in a penthouse
Baby, I'm sorry, but I'm sexy
And all I want you to do is just bless me, let's see
This kid that I'm waitin' on
He said he love when my jeans look painted on
Wit a tight white tee, you ain't quite like me
Probably why I'm always getting hated on
Now shorty trynna push up on me like a Wonderbra
Listen, when I speak out I wouldn't want you take it wrong
Now number one, I don't need you
Ya name's Q, I only see you when I see you
Listen two, you can never play me
(Why is that? Why is that?)
'Cause I'm such a' lady

Который не растаял, как на грех
В густой тени свой холод скрыв от всех
Так чувства в глубине душевных вех
Эй, Скажи, как мне закрыть теперь
Любви непростую дверь
Смирившись с болью потерь?
Пусть свет в твоих глазах погас
И больше завтра нет у нас
Там, где спираль из вечных дней
Бродить дано душе твоей
Сказать «Прощай!» тебе не смог
Застрял в плену своих дорог
На месте, вот итог
Как сон
И чар его неразрушимый звон
А может, он проклятьем заклеймён
И этот груз нести я обречён
Эй, Какой сюжет грядущих дней
Искать душе моей
Средь городских площадей?
Холодных слёз заклятый дождь
Замёрзнет льдом, бросая в дрожь
Хитря, что всё во благо нам
Пока сползает по щекам
В тот миг, хотя любили мы
Разлучены потоком тьмы
Итог истории одной зимы
Пусть всё с тобой, теряя цвет
Однажды вдруг сойдёт на нет

1 ContributorShinzou wo Sasageyo LyricsВерить так хотелось, правда
Уже не будет больше ада
Но только худших дней засада
Ждала тихонько нас
У ворот знакомый грохот
Он всё сильнее, это плохо
И худший день опять с подвохом
Кошмаром в этот час
Тех, кто предал прошлое, уж не простить
Все они - враги, которых нужно истребить
В тот ужасный день смотрели пристально на нас
Сотни грозных лиц и тысячи глаз
Чтобы пережить кошмар
Мне нужно лишь сражаться
Судьбы ставя под удар и прошлое
Согласен я с душой расстаться
И жизнь отдай! И жизнь отдай!
И сердца самый яркий свет отдай!
Все жертвы вмиг попали в рай
Об этом просто ты не забывай
И жизнь отдай! И жизнь отдай!
И сердца самый яркий свет отдай!
Смелей вперёд к судьбе шагай!
Рукой свой путь пробивай!
Тех, кто ход истории перевирал
Нужно ненавидеть как врагов, их час настал
Тоном мудрецов и ложью под иконостас
Обманули так легко и подло нас
Этих демонов убить желаний наших хватит
И стратегию сложить, и тактику
И сил напрасно не потратить!
И жизнь отдай! И жизнь отдай!
И сердца самый яркий свет отдай!
Все чувства ты сейчас впитай
И силы на сегодня рассчитай
И жизнь отдай! И жизнь отдай!
И сердца самый яркий свет отдай!
Смелей вперёд к судьбе шагай!
Рукой победу забирай!
Странные чудовища похожи на людей
Уничтожить их хочу, очистить мир скорей
До последней капли уничтожить без следа
Пусть мир забудет ужас навсегда!
Я не помню, кто сказал об этом самый первый
Но как струны нервы вспышкой гнев горит в глазах
Ярость незабвенна и давно повержен страх
Я уничтожу все причины зла!
Куда приведёт нас долгая дорога
Через сожаленья всё же выбранный путь?
Жизней в жертву было много
Но с пути нельзя нам свернуть
К победе вновь рискнуть
И за дверью бога
В мир, что нам обещан, шагнуть
Вспомнились снова все униженья
И страх от их власти принёс сомненья
Вновь
Обиды вечной метки
И страшный плен, и клетки
Будоражат кровь
В сумерках стрелы, словно на крыльях, летят
Нам их не вернуть назад
Из этих линий
Мы к свободе свой путь продвинем
И жизнь отдай! И жизнь отдай!
И сердца самый яркий свет отдай!
За всех вокруг сейчас страдай
И на сегодня силы рассчитай
И жизнь отдай! И жизнь отдай!
И сердца самый яркий свет отдай!
Судьбу свою огнём сжигай
А жизнь навечно в стрелы превращай!
И жизнь отдай! И жизнь отдай!
И сердца самый яркий свет отдай!

Да нас ломали

Но не смогут обмануть
В плен
Их этих стен
Ты бросил души, словно тлен

Теряют цвет

Тёмных сил и грёз
И боль наша вряд ли станет сном

Опять живём
Ты дошёл до финала, ты жив, но мёртв в душе
Довольно жертв!

Вперёд всегда стремится звезда
Вперёд всегда стремится звезда
Вперёд всегда стремится звезда
Вперёд всегда мчится звезда!
Эй-эй-эй, на раз-два-три банку открывай
Мой голод не утолить, и по жизни штормит пускай
Хоть ливень не вечен, мокнуть не намерен
Лучше зонтик мне подай
«Я хочу того, я хочу сего, я хочу всего!» — только что с того?
Ведь я счастливым быть желаю
Ведь я спокойно жить желаю
Мир в хаос погрузить желаю
И навеки покой обрести
Я в сердце, что в груди твоей всё бьётся
Хочу, сражённый счастьем
Век с тобой не разлучаться
А если есть Рай лишь для хороших парней
То там нет места мне
Раз так сильна любовь
Я готов всем с тобой делиться, детка
Вперёд звезда стремится
Вперёд звезда стремится
Вперёд звезда стремится
Опять забыл я что-то…
Ну как настрой?
Всем счастья хватило?
Хочу примерным стать
Но это скукота
Ну как настрой?
Хватило ли счастья тебе?
Вперёд звезда стремится
Вперёд звезда стремится
Вперёд звезда стремится
А разве не чудесно?
Вперёд всегда стремится звезда

35914,Jackie-O,HOLLOW HUNGER,"HOLLOW HUNGER Lyrics
Не унять мне жажду опять
По ночам страдаю я сам
Постепенно стал моим даже необъятный мир -
В этой костлявой руке он лежит
О, мой крик и неба достиг!
Ночь темна и грусти полна
Все желанья претворил
Но не угас мой пыл:
Жажду большего. (Во-о-о-оу!)
Полный надежд будущий день
За блеском славы не могу разглядеть
И возношу к небу мольбы
Пусть даже тщетны они!
(Я жажду большей силы!)
Может, костями в танце погремим
В мире, воссозданном твоими кошмарами?
До исступленья в танце закружив
В небытии себя утратим мы
(Па-па-па-ра-ра-ра)
(Ра-па-па-па-па-ра) Но не очнуться ото сна
(Ра-па-па-па-па-ра) Пусть он сгинет, сгинет!
(Ра-па-па-па-па-ра) Тьма бесконечно глубока
(Ра-па-па-па-па-ра) В ней могу бесследно
Утонуть мгновенно… я
Взгляд пустой наполнен тоской
Поддержи - во мне гаснет жизнь!
Раз всего одну мечту исполнить не могу
Злоба верх берёт. (Во-о-о-оу!)
Как должен я повелевать
Если в мире этом оставлен блуждать?
Но и во сне славой гоним -
Голод мой неутолим!
(Не жажду больше силы!)
Смело в пучину погрузимся мы
Мыслями тяжкими не обременённые
Вместе достигнем самой глубины
Опьянены своими грёзами
(Па-па-па-ра-ра-ра)
Пусть надежда эта слабая пока
Словно звёзды в небе далека
Знаю, что к ней никогда не прикоснусь
Но рукой тянусь!
Я жажду большей силы!
В танце извечном вместе закружим
Тщетным стремлением к величию ослеплены!
Может, костями в танце погремим
В мире, воссозданном твоими кошмарами?
Танцем греховным заворожены
В небытии себя утратим мы
(Па-па-па-ра-ра-ра)
(Ра-па-па-па-па-ра) Но не очнуться ото сна
(Ра-па-па-па-па-ра) Пусть он сгинет, сгинет!
(Ра-па-па-па-па-ра) Тьма бесконечно глубока

1 ContributorAkuma no Ko LyricsСтальные снаряды - орудие правды
Сражая врага, меня героем делают
Глаза закрываю и не понимаю
Где демон, а где человек - ведь на ощупь всё одно
Мой час уже близок, а кто примет вызов?
Пускай за стеною появился я на свет
Но жизнь непростую оплакивать не буду
И всё потому, что границ с этих пор нет!
Дай крылья мне судьба, я мог бы хоть куда
Отправиться по небу всем вопреки
Но потеряв свой дом, внезапно осознал, что
Мне некуда теперь идти!
Такую жизнь я ненавижу всей душой
Мир так жесток, но назло ему
Буду любить до конца тебя одну
Всё в жертву я смело принесу
Чтоб защищать до конца тебя одну
Сколько бы ни оступался я
Больше колебаться мне нельзя
Ведь прав всегда лишь тот
Кто сквозь шторма невзгод
В душе своей уверенность несёт
Стальные снаряды, что сыпятся градом
Невольно в этот миг сцену фильма мне напомнили:
Постыдно и грязно в сражениях праздных
Во имя страны разорённой гибли воины
За что же, по-правде, врагов презираю
Так сильно, что гнев постоянно в сердце копится?
Вот только на это нигде нет ответа
От противоречий сбежать просто нельзя!
Заветные слова не сможешь никогда
Перевести ты, смысл их передав
В реальный хрупкий мир нам остается верить
И широко глаза открыть!
Такую жизнь я ненавижу всей душой
Мир так жесток, но назло ему
Буду любить до конца тебя одну
Всё в жертву я смело принесу
Чтоб защищать до конца тебя одну
Избранный оставит яркий след
Изгнанный окончит путь в земле
Отныне понял я, что демона дитя
Безудержно росло внутри меня
Дорогою побед вело день изо дня

Но прохладно в этом доме…
Ты ушёл… И жизнь уходит…
Постепенно и легко
Без тебя зачем она?
В маске больше жить не стану
Не зажмёшь ты эту рану
Не загладится вина
Этот финал — ещё не финал… встретимся мы снова…
То, что искал… и с чем ты остался… это всё так бестолково…
Страшно… Тяжело…
Расстался я с тобой
Прекрасным летним днём
В последний выходной
Уехал… без тебя…
Утратил… навсегда…
А забрал с собой - лишь имя
В никуда
Прощай, мечта…
Лагерь выдал мне
Семь дней и семь ночей
Чтоб разобраться в нём
И разобраться… в ней
И в этот малый срок
Я сделал, всё что мог
Но её одну оставил
Спустил курок
Холод чувствую внутри
Но тепло в моей квартире
От свечи, как жизнь, горящей
Быстро, ярко и не зря
Вот потухла и она
Ты и я — погасли тоже
Ванна стала смертным ложем
В этом лишь моя вина
Этот финал — ещё не финал… встретимся мы снова
Если б я знал, если б я только знал
На что же ты была готова…

И в этом бесподобном, тихом величии
Лагерь наш затерян, как в сене игла
Сюда, нарушив к жизни моё безразличие

Из суровой зимы города охладелого

Лес со мною делится с каждым листом
Эта сила меня питает и помогает мне
С утра и до ночи, здесь или там
И для каждого дня раскачивает, как маятник
Радости в помощи чьим-то делам и мечтам
Что ждёт с тобою в будущем нас, мне неведомо
Вдруг оно заставит ещё нас страдать
У озера ночью мне думать об этом не
Хочется, а хочется лишь наблюдать

Образ смерти так привычен…

Стрелы нам помочь не против…
Мы за добычей!
Здесь не может быть приличий
Забудь!
Те, кто видит цель
Стремятся к этой цели
Будет дней ли цепь
Месяцы, недели…
Может сбыться сон
Если постараться
Или может он
Просто сном остаться…
Забудь глупые мечты
Это лишь иллюзия твоя
Поверь, всё, что видишь ты
Детская бравада, только зря
Может просто сон сбылся наяву…
Ты не видишь разницы теперь
Но время не вернуть назад, поверь
В этом сне ты только охотник
И инстинкт диктует правила
Ты - убийца, смерти угодник
Смерть идти вперёд заставила…
В клетке не будем терпеть униженья!
Стрелы возмездия - для сраженья!
Там за стеной, где заря занималась
Жертва охотников заждалась
Тело сжигает пламя страсти -

Я вновь один. (Я вновь один.)
Не оставляй меня снова позади
И время есть, (И время есть)
Останься здесь, (Останься здесь)
Уверен, не смогу путь я преодолеть
И стрелки на часах бегут всё, подгоняя и меня
Мне понятно, наслаждаясь ложью, в прошлом я застрял
Страхи всё одолевают, что один я навсегда
Не хочу вот так закончить и прошу тебя – поверь в меня
Хоть я бегу, но на месте остаюсь
Вновь я упал, и я всё ещё боюсь
Ищу тот путь, что все прошли уже давно
Ты далеко
Я обманут жизнью, потому теперь скитаюсь
Всё ещё иду, но постепенно замедляюсь
От себя, кто был когда-то брошен, отделяюсь –
Это всё, что от детства мне теперь осталось
Я боюсь, что вновь меня оставят одного
Словно поезд, что пронёсся, сбив остатки сердца
А в глазах моих уж не осталось ничего
Так боюсь, что буду тем, кто и не заберётся
Вверх
Днями, ночами я плачу опять
Сил не хватает что-то изменять
Мне надоело тексты писать
Вокруг микрофонов не сосчитать
Себя я пытаюсь исправить, чтобы не стесняться, как раньше теперь
И в зеркало глядя скажу я: “Попробуй ка стать немного ты сильней”
Всем покажи, кто ты есть —
Кто смог на вершину залезть
Внутри исчезает намерений блеск
Спроси у себя — у тебя они есть?
А люди всё также, кто рядом когда-то стояли, всё дальше уходят вперёд
Один остаюсь в стороне, не хочу видеть такое уже, е!
Так быстро всё, мне за тобой не углядеть
Но в ожидании тебя, я всё же здесь —
На той дороге, что прошли с тобой вдвоём
Ты далеко
Холодный ветер в спину, я один теперь скитаюсь
Всё ещё иду, но постепенно замедляюсь
В чёрно-белый цвет вместе с пейзажем превращаюсь
Становясь картинкой, что сама нарисовалась
Я боюсь, что вновь меня оставят одного
Словно поезд, что пронёсся, сбив остатки сердца
А в глазах моих уж не осталось ничего

“Что там, мне все равно, до каждой мошки дела нет”, -
Из моих уст звучали слова как полный бред
Я подавлен был, разлил случайно кофе
Так день за днем я жил, пока однажды мы с тобой
Не повстречались случайно
Как мне быть, как мне быть? Крепко я увяз
В промозглой рутине хиппи-города
Как же мне, как же найти причину?
“Все предельно важно!” - звучит красиво только на словах
По ту сторону пробудилось нечто неизведанное
И с собою утащить пытается зачем-то нас
Уйти ты не готова, и потому останешься сейчас.(час-час-час)
Останешься сейчас. (час-час-час)
“Обо мне заботились, обо мне заботились
Вы всегда прилежно
Хоть я все забыла, но молчать не в силах“, -
На лице твоем могу я прочитать
Везде, куда хватает глаз
Передо мной раскинулись сейчас
Искусные подделки
Пусть невольно я порчу все подряд
Пора в игру вступать мне
Если, закрыв глаза на все, просто прикушу язык
Ложью “Я так и знал” лишь заведу себя в тупик
На эмоции щедра ты непривычно
И вот, и вот твое лицо на миг озарилось
Немыслимо чудесной красотой!
Но тоскою по тебе душа терзается дни напролет
И себя теряю, в мыслей падая водоворот
За грань реальной жизни шагнуть боясь, останешься сейчас.(час-час-час)
В гетто жизнь.. Все это сумасшедший наш мир...
Как мне быть, как мне быть? Крепко я увяз
В промозглой рутине хиппи-города
Как же мне, как же найти причину?
“Все предельно важно!” - звучит красиво только на словах
По ту сторону пробудилось нечто неизведанное
И с собою утащить пытается зачем-то нас
Уйти ты не готова, и потому останешься сейчас
Но тоскою по тебе душа терзается дни напролет
И себя теряю, в мыслей падая водоворот
За грань реальной жизни шагнуть боясь, останешься сейчас. (час-час-час)

Воу)
Я слышал уже не раз:
«Никого в мире лучше нет вас»
Но теперь с теченьем дней
Славы груз всё тяжелей
Музыке отдав сердца
Мы трудились в поте лица
И клялись, что не сдадимся до конца
Хоть немало лет пронеслось уже
Тот же мальчик я в душе
Ведь всё ещё впереди, впереди
А, скажи, о чем ты мечтал?
Скажи, каким ты видел финал?
Всё ещё впереди, да
А, и даже ночью во сне
Не прекратим стремиться к мечте
Впереди
А, тянуться к облакам
Будем до конца
Всё ещё впереди, да
А, мы лишь в начале пути
Ведь всё впереди
Хотя навесили довольно красочный ярлык
Никто из нас к подобной ноше так и не привык
Я лишь предан музыке, как и всегда
И эти чувства не сумели изменить года
Нет, ничего не изменилось, сомневаетесь — ну и пусть (Нет)
Но вопреки переменам, я собою остаюсь
И всё так же иду навстречу новой цели
Как и в тринадцать, рифмы мне ещё не надоели
Я очень многому учусь, я к очень многому стремлюсь
А если спросишь: «Почему?», ответ в твоих глазах найду
Ведь нам не важно, чего другие ждут
Ведь нам не важно, что нас лучшими зовут
Ведь нам не важно, долой короны и призы
Ведь нам не важнло, лишь надежды и мечты —
Вот это важно, и пройдя весь долгий путь, мы вновь на старте
Вновь на старт
Хоть немало лет пронеслось уже
Тот же мальчик я в душе
Ведь всё ещё впереди, впереди
А, скажи, о чем ты мечтал?
Скажи, каким ты видел финал?
Всё ещё впереди, да
А, и даже ночью во сне
Не прекратим стремиться к мечте
Впереди
А, тянуться к облакам
Будем до конца
Всё ещё впереди, да
А, мы лишь в начале пути
Ведь всё впереди
— А достиг ли всех вершин? (Вершин)
Что будет дальше, покажи (Что будет дальше, покажи)
Оставив позади
Полно прекрасных воспоминаний
— Да, немало покорил вершин (Вершин)
К новым двигаться решил (К новым двигаться решил)
И продолжу до зари
Со мною уставши, шагают дальше

Любовь – разменная монета
Ждёт фаворит другой под дивным светом ламп
Жестокость ночью – знакомый штамп
Да, да, да
Был должен знать и о подобном
Был должен знать по кровожадным твоим глазам
Кровожадным лжи словам
Да, да, да
Худшую вещь создал ад –
Знать, что лишь я виноват
Мне известно, ты – яд, отравой вмиг объят
Как будто на игле я, глотаю, жалея
Дай скорее яд, сил нужен заряд
Как в последний раз жить – крутая идея
О-о-о-о
Раз меня так хочешь, детка
Ну тогда отдамся я легко-о-о-о
Конец главы моей простой отправит яд твой
Меняю впредь умело маски
И научился сладко сочинять сказки я
Вмиг расстроюсь под мотив вранья
Да, да, да
Сложно устоять всегда
Мне от нового глотка
Да, известно, там яд, отравой вмиг объят
От вкуса цепенею, глотаю, жалея
Дай скорее яд, сил нужен заряд
Как в последний раз жить – крутая идея
О-о-о-о
Раз меня так хочешь, детка
Ну тогда отдамся я легко-о-о-о
Конец главы моей простой отправит яд твой
Да, яд, на дно заведёт яд
Наполнил я бокал, но полным не стал он
Вновь внутри яд, достал так уже яд

ждёт, как давний друг
Сам себе громко на ухо шепчу
Чтобы проснуться и быть начеку
Время вспомнить про близкий круг
Игрок, идя вслепую, импульсивно, увы
Угодил в эпицентр беды
Ценю, несомненно, любые советы
Пускай потом открою я глаза
Крича раздражённо, был съеден
Но руки опускать нельзя
Хочешь со мной податься ты в мишени?
Как умру – неизвестно
И буду я благодарен, если песню
Споёшь надрывно для меня
Был бы счастлив я познать прилив тепла
Ночью, что всегда отчаянья полна
Думал наперёд о жизни без забот
Рад, что первым смог я достич высот
Спокойным быть я хочу
И не желаю доставлять
Ненужный дискомфорт совсем никому
Но лишь дав отпор, я сумею пройти отбор
Простая правда ясна
Крича раздражённо, был съеден
Но руки опускать нельзя
Хочешь со мной податься ты в мишени?
Как умру – неизвестно
И буду я благодарен, если песню
Споёшь надрывно для меня
Предлагаю в цу-е-фа поиграть нам
Согласие своё даёшь, так по рукам
Не имею сдаваться права
На подсознании буду счастлив
Если споёшь надрывно для меня
Внахлёст:
Был бы счастлив я  познать прилив тепла
Ночью, что всегда отчаянья полна
Думал наперёд о жизни без забот
Рад, что первым смог ...
Немного беспокоен, и поэтому смеюсь
От банальных и до боли пустых мелочей
Стресс едой не заем, хлынет он сильней
Злюсь и только больше устаю
Но я верю что устою

А в другой — что под контроль не взять
Я не хочу боль причинять
Это говорил всё время
Невольно взгляд назад кидаю
Застигнут был дилеммой я врасплох
Искал, как сделать вдох
Страдая
Ждёт эпилог, но что я смог?
В чём твой порок?
Я повидал зарю
Холодный воздух узнаю
Проснусь, чтоб каждый раз понять
Мир гибнет в плаче, всюду неудачи
Под маской жертвы как-то жить привык
А ты обман раскрыла
Канет всё насовсем
Если встанешь вновь на те же грабли
Чтоб выжить, ты
Заплатишь всем
Да, в одной руке лишь клочья
Но в другой руке неуёмный жар огня
Бремя завтрашнего дня
Расцвечу я глубокой ночью
Со всем покончить счёл я долгом
Альтернативы лучшей точно нет
Погас мгновенно свет
Надолго
Знаю ли, как подняться?
День «иск» настал, и
Вспомнил вновь
Всё, что был забыть готов
Мечтаешь день за днём
Об иллюзорном мире ты
Вставай, убыток оцени
Знай, перемены ждут нас непременно
Пусть перепутаны теперь следы
Пойдём без колебаний
В чём твой главный грех?
Он зависит от того, что ценно
Пойдём ли мы
Против всех?
Увидел я зарю
Холодный воздух тут узнаю
Я просыпаюсь для боёв

Борись за жизнь!
Гоню по новой сны под предлогом тишины
Он как будто говорит, что тревоги дни полны
Ищу я идеал, основу всех начал
Отвернулся, и тогда смех людей сильнее стал
Скажут: «Ты — великий»
Представь и вновь на пике
Оу, какой облом
Каждый хочет быть тайком моим врагом
Только напролом
Каждый хочет быть тайком моим врагом (ом-ом-ом-ом)
(Борись за жизнь!)
Моим врагом (ом-ом-ом-ом)
(Борись за жизнь!)
Но готов я...
Сраженья тут и там, и победу не отдам
Я запомнил тех, кто ждал мой провал по всем фронтам
Хотите выгнать вон? Только это был разгон
О намереньях легко заявляю в микрофон
Скажут: «Ты — великий»
Представь и вновь на пике
Оу, какой облом
Каждый хочет быть тайком моим врагом
Только напролом
Каждый хочет быть тайком моим врагом (ом-ом-ом-ом)
(Борись за жизнь!)
Моим врагом (ом-ом-ом-ом)
(Борись за жизнь!)
Стой, окей
Я верю, кто-то вознесет мольбы
Я вновь молю о счастье у судьбы
Я там, где никто не может быть
Б-б-брошен
Боль тупая не гложет
Прост на подъём, ну погнала в путь вдвоём
Дорога долгая, педаль — в пол, и мы зажжём
Противник на подходе, невидим и на взводе я
«Hasta Luego». Свободен
Ты — жалкий сноб, хватит проб, этот топ
Он по праве мой, небанален я
Будто астронавт
Взмыл давно с планеты и поснял беды
Лучше дня на свете нет и на примете
Не думал, что наделал я шума
Лобовой атакой. Это так?
Наблюдаю за дракой, всем поставлю
На автомате шах и мат
Буду краток: хватит пряток
Паники нет, вынес
Плавно всех
Ты тут главный?
На попятной за горло призжат!
Каждый хочет быть тайком моим врагом
Только напролом
Каждый хочет быть тайком моим врагом (ом-ом-ом-ом)
Оу, какой облом
Каждый хочет быть тайком моим врагом
Только напролом
Каждый хочет быть тайком моим врагом

Не мучай душу свою прошлым, родная
И не ищи, я лишь рассказ из твоих снов

Говорю, тебя я к морю приведу
А станет лучше, я попытаюсь вмиг
Не давать обещаний, если не сдержу
Если я завтра исчезну
Стихнет ли волна?
Должен был ли я стыдиться
Что были счастливы тогда?
Если кану в темноте не стоит слезы лить
Пока я рядом ...
Сможем пережить
Сказал...
Не мучай душу свою прошлым, родная
И не ищи, я лишь рассказ из твоих снов
Продлим обман еще немного
Ведь и без нас жизнь идет вперед
Я так привыкнуть к этому боюсь
Тебя держат лозы в комнате своей
Когда-нибудь мы будем здесь лежать
Должен я море привести скорей
Меня встретишь в темном свете
Как тогда давно
Я почувствую касанье
Чтоб страданье вмиг прошло
Я не хотел тебя тревожить
Извиненья не нужны
Меня забыть просил я
Но осталась ты

I hope that bitch got my cheese, can't leave with less than a G
I'm scopin' out some new talent, needs some new hoes for my palace
The more hoes that I just grab, they hating on me like melon
Soon as I hit the front door, they scope the gold around my collar
I'm here to come up on loot, I can't even spare a dollar
I got to roll gang style, bitch
I got a Rolex on my wrist trick
Can't you hoes get some of this
Some niggas want to take my place
Some hoes be beggin' ride my dick
I can't be stopped, the Juice gon' shine
The droopies pokin' in my rhyme
I'm living good and feelin' fine
I'm high off weed, then liqour and wine
Just roll it up, I fold it up
The bottles pop, pour it in my cup
The niggas who work from 9 to 5
Are on the corner, posted up
We still can ball, the Juice and Paul
The deals we make, the shots we call
Entrepeneurs on world wide tours
The only thing we save is cheese not broads

Smiling in your face mean mug it with a pistol play
Know you bitches out to hate me I'm self explanatory
I'll leave you wet like a fat pussy in an orgy
Snatch your fucking soul I'm the cold that's in the winters hoe
Mess with me you die you can't tango with my .44
Drinkin' on some Henny VSOP, it be in me, bitch
Smokin' on some weed, a hundred percent, it be fire, bitch
What you tryin' to do, I done already did it, baby
If you wanna rumble, get your ass up, don't be a baby (Come on, come on, come on)
Plain as it may be we done talked around each one of your cities
Ask my brother Eric he be witnessing what he ain't seen
But she don't bother no one she be Mrs. Lady claiming clout
On your ass we'll make a test to blast what they talking bout

Hope you study hard

High till the day that I die
Or will you kiss me good bye
I'm bout it, whatever bitch

Quick in the dick
I'll put your ass inn a trunk

On your ass so simple
I'm laid back on this track

Throw your setts in the air (throw your setts in the air)
Scrip your killas and killas
About your dealas on the block
Makin' money that's right
About the ladies on the real lookin' for a late night
Don't be surprised when you see me

How does your hatred grew?
With skin of snake and rabid bait we're going straight to hell
Rosemary, bloody cherries
What does your crystal show?
Bloody rates and bloody faith, you’re going straight to hell
This shit that I’m cooking you be better working
Cause its wicked and now when I play with you hoes
This shit is witch brew
My attitude is fuck you, you know
Had to bring it one more time
I love to make my haters sick
Laughing out loud, rolling with cheddar
My niggas is down with triple the six
Paying attention suppose to be gossiping
Constantly keeping my name in they mouth
Blowing and smoking I'm travelling getting my money
The hardest La Boo in the South
Industry dudes make me sick sometime
Be acting like your shit don't stick like mine
But the nigga I roll with his ass is awesome
Fuck your opinion, I don’t wanna be bothered
Everybody knows that real G's move in silence
Everybody knows that broke necks don't tell
Everybody knows the possibility of violence
Everybody knows they don't want to see me click
Most of the time in the studio fresh
Cooking up poison
Pulling their heads
Getting some hay
Counting them stacks
Highly upgraded two bitches attest my gangsta
Hollow tips got you red splitter splatter
Like a painter
I don’t wanna be like her
I wanna be like him
I need bitch, no thank ya
My crystal ball and I’m the queen
Bitch bow down
I have the will power to shut your whole world down

Got to get your friends
They about your business
Bust your head living in these ditches
Murk your family, don't need no witness
Check the bitch the assassin menace
Wouldn't want to play with this video game
Got the gang numbers first and you can get it up with me
Got the cop killers on stand-by
Do a drive-by
Make your mama cry-cry
Nigga buy red dye on your black eye
You will die if you are trying looking at my guy
You will lie blood across the face so high
In the sky real bitches make the moon mine
Niggas die anything that I want nigga
I could buy everybody hey check bitch
And that's why every morning that I wake up
Looking I'm waking up look at the mirror
Laugh at my set because I the one they fear her
Up another 
And she's still talking shit but nobody hear her
Put her in the trunk with the pump to her head
Got her scared mislead she been bleed on the grave
Fuck her own partner, bitch won't tell the bitch she dead
Another day, Imma buy a new Luger
You niggas shoot her
Mama taught to kill or be killed, I'm the tutor
So if you hoes gonna get some up your ass gotta gun
Me an Boo we gonna bring this shit to ya

Bustin' bitches daily, maybe it's the herb in me

Freakin' like Vanessa Del Rio, won't you take you a peak

You fuckin' bitch, spittin' rhythms in your rhyme like a joke
I'm gonna tote you like a 90 when I'm pullin' that dope
I know you're hopin' that I'll fall to my face, but I ain't

With bats and Prophet dank
Yellin' thangs, I'm comin' up
And niggas want your life to live
Pack that steel if you real
But you better shoot to kill
All that flossin' ain't gon' do
Bring a gun without the clip
And for the rest of your life
You'll be walkin' around with a half-ass limp
Read my lips, don't FUCK with us
Because we dangerous
And when we on that good stuff
Like a junkie, we be anxious
To get up in yo shit
And take your life with all quickness
A Orange Mound playa that be strictly bout his business

It be funny how a nigga acting stingy wit they money
Why do you be in the club, you make it harder for a thug
That be spending all they money, popping bottles, smoking bud

Ain't no money in the club, damn that shit is fucked up
I got bills to pay, but a sista gonna suck it up
If its a good night, I can easy make a thousand daily
If they bring the bustas they proverted keep ya mouth away
Hit the, hit the stage, bring it, bring it on to the flo'
Stick the money in my lace strap if you want a show
I'm a private dancer, be yo love slave for a while
Most niggas trip, when you diss, tip 'em wit they eyes
Flawging ass niggas really muthafuck'n kill me

35953,Gangsta Boo,I’ll Be the Other Woman,"To begin how it ended
We lived happily ever after
Me and her man
We's of the other woman
Let's begin the chapter
It was a very pretty day
If I remember it was Easter
I was chillin' with my girl
She say somebody wants to meet ya
It's all good, so how he look
Then she pulled me out a picture
Not to get explicit with ya
But this man I gotta get him
(Here's his name and his number)
Damn she tryin' to hook us up
But it's cool, 'cause he look good
Then I'm single so what the fuck
(Time has passed)
It feel good to have this man of mine
He spend his time to wine and dine
On what he called divine
I think I love him
The only thing that be bleedin' my heart
All the pain and rain I feel baby when we apart
When we apart
I wanted to do this
Boy be cheatin' on me
Maybe so
Cause this crazy love to me
Is too good to be true
So Mrs. Lady Boo
Is just 'gon cherish the time
With my man the one that I believe is not only mine
I'll be the other woman (be the other woman)
Just as long as I know (long as I know)
That I'm the only other woman
You give cash to
I'll be the other woman (I'll be the other woman)
But I got to know (She's got to know)
That I'm the only other woman
You give cash to
It's kinda crazy don't you think
That I'm fallin' so quick
I think my friend hooked me up
With a player type trick
That boy be spendin' all his cheese
Like he got it like that
I ain't the one complainin'
Shorty scratches my back
(But are you down)
All the time
I got love for you baby
Count your money and your saddy
Sippin' crissy with lady
A trip to Paris (would be nice)
I got you if you got me
To live in ecstasy is what the both of us should try to see
But I'm creepin' yo front seat
Never me cause your money
Keepin' me on my two feet
I'm independent can't you see
Never tryin' to be rude
But I'm the one you love to hate
But I love you too
I hate you so the point is even trade
I need to thank my friend for hookin' us up
So now it's me and you
We Bonnie and Clyde baby in this
I thought you knew sweetie
I'm on a mission to the top
Yes your darling Boo
His and her Rolex's watch for our whole crew
I'll be the other woman (be the other woman)
Just as long as I know (long as I know)
That I'm the only other woman
You give cash to
I'll be the other woman (I'll be the other woman)
But I got to know (She's got to know)
That I'm the only other woman
You give cash to
I'm just carryin' on
I forgot about your wife
I recently answered yo pager
It was her, she called you twice
(Were you nice)
Hell no, I still got some jealous in me
Because we makin' love doesn't mean I don't got envy
I wish that we be
Somewhere on our own land
Countin' Benji's, talkin', chillin', makin' castles in sand
Understand it's me and you
Boy you don't need to play me
I'm kinda crazy
You check my background daily
(Are you crazy lady)
I'm trying to be real
You tryin' to be fake
You still got this broad calin' you
(You must be crazy baby)
But it's all good cause I'm a woman 'bout mine
As long as you spendin' all your time with this lady
Cause I'm the one
I keep the tons of funs waitin' for ya
When your wife ain't yet home
She just a hatin' ya, what a shame
I be the one to blame when drama kicks off
But I'm 'gon be the one to blame
When I take her butt off
I'll be the other woman (be the other woman)
Just as long as I know (long as I know)

I'm the razor in your wrist
I'm the medicine you hit
Got you bucking throwing fits
Kicking chairs and swinging fists
How long can you get to this?
Blay!
It started way back when a nigga was a kid
I stick and move my nigga
That's the shit that I did
I broke a few fucking bones
And I cast few stones
I pulled a few fucking tones
Man that shit wasn't wrong
You got me stuck in the zone
When a nigga doing wrong
I pop you once in your head with that goddamn chrome
Don't give a fuck motherfucker
If your family mourn
Shouldnta stepped to me dawg
Shouldnta stepped to me at all
You weak busta!
A mistaken ID
Wanna put me in the po-key
Cuz I'm on parole
Police swearing that they know he
Had to do the shit
Cuz Project Pat is a convict
Whose North Memphis raised
Hood bred taking no shit
If I did the hit
You'll be left okey dokey
Still selling dope on the motherfucking lowski
When I pull the tone
After that squeeze the trigger
On any punk bitch or a ho ass nigga!
See I'mma gon and have to kill a bitch
Empty the clip
I guess that's the only way
A ho gon' keep my name out they lips
La Chat ain't with no bullshit
I be burying ya hoes
And I'mma do it for the wantin' bitch
Fuck a low low
Man I'm a mean bitch I tell ya
I done been there done that
It ain't no mission I can't finish
Nothing ain't too tough for Chat
So if you catch me slippin' ho
Hope you wearing a mask
Cuz once I know its you fo sho
I'mma cremate ya ass
Can a nigga get chose in these kinda clothes
Have you seen a memphis playa
Ride Bentley or Rolls
I done told ya that I'm always gonna stand on ten toes
With a liquor bottle cracked, and a blunt already rolled
My cologne smell the curb
Just superb on these hoes
Hanging with these Memphis killas
With that candy round they nose
On my neck on my wrist
Is that jewelry that be froze
On my face is my cartier shades and my golds
Is this a stain to be making?
It's a T-Rock creation
No roofer sniper you facing
I'm like an offspring of Satan
My innovation of danger
From the slugs of the chamber
Keep more guns than a ranger
Prepared to mangle a stranger
My competition deleted
From verbal telekenisis
Placing bodies in ditches
And leave them stinking like feces
Once the leech is depleted
Fold my dollars like creases
My coalition is the Hypnotize Camp
Its no secret nigga!
If I go commit a stang
I got two Glocks and a blunt
Bout to let you bitches know
That Gangsta Boo don't give a fuck
I got diamonds on my wrist
I got diamonds in my teeth
Is it a bird? Is it a bee?
Can you bitches picture me?
Talking shit about Ms. Lady
When you know you wanna fuck
Ridin' round town clowning
Doing donuts in the truck
Smack you bitches to the flo'
Fuck yo nigga take his dough
I be Mrs. ""Where Da Dollas At?""
You hatas know the score
I be ballin ATL
I hit Brad up on the cell
Told him meet me at the swiss
And bring some niggas to the 'tel
Might as well go on playa
Ya'll ain't ready for the gangsta ho

See, this is the prime example, of some enquiring minds
Mothafuckas in my business
Mothafuckas wanna know what I do
Why, nigga?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Why y'all in my business?
Enquiring Minds, nigga
Ya know what I'm sayin?
This the intro
I'm bringin' it to you real
Fuck these mothafuckas
They ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Y'all know how they niggas is
These some mothafuckin' playa haters
What?
Nigga, do you want me to fuck you up? so
Hit you with a low blow
Jive, dawg
You might as well call it quits
I be the bitch that's known for rockin' shit
I be the bitch known as a lyricist
So, what? You wanna fuck with me on the M-I-C?
You better call the police 'cause I'ma bring ya to your knees
Me and the tear da club up thugs can't take enough
Comin' thicker than the mothafuckin' U.S. Marines
So if you wanna fuck with me, my favorite quote's
I'ma take it as a joke (Try me, try me, try me)
Got your ass wishin' that you can tag me, baby
Got you hard up like a soap on a rope
I thought I told ya we ain't gon' stop
It's on
So when it's on, life's on, then the bitch is on
Early mornin', put the niggas in they own zone
Enquiring minds wanted to know, that's why I wrote this song (Bitch)
Wanna fuck me bitch
Wanna wear my shit 'cause I got Chanel on it
But in the projects you weren't really on it
Tryna be the one to flaunt it
Stupid ass, know that my name is wanted
Ayy, ayy
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Wassup, niggas?
This the intro
Nigga, you got one
You got two
You got three
Yo, yo
Uh

Ayy, ayy, yo, yo
Stop this shit, and play number three

Meanin' stayin' real wit them mutha-fuckin' niggas

They can take you out of this

Livin' day by day
Repeat 1
Say you real - real enough to make a fuckin mil'
Real - real enough to make a mutha-fuckin' field
Every fuckin' word you say has gotta be real
I hate you really feel that way (You know the business)
A little somethin' for nothin' got you scared of it
A little somethin' for nothin' got you fed up, fed up
With all the playa haters, playa haters hangin'  ?
Now a nigga like me, put a little like somethin' in the rear
Shoot nothin' but knowledge at your gate
Crunchy Black look like the red

All I want is profit man

Used to have a fuckin' soul
Now my soul's fuckin' stole

Once we feel you crossed us
Never bein' blinded by the pettiness your ass play
Bust a free for ?? fuck niggas 24 hours a day
Wanted to get paid, so I started this rappin' shit
Now it be my name dragged through dirt for the fuck of it
I know what it takes to win, that's why I fight with my pen
There's so many haters on the outside tryin' to get they ass in
Never be clever like Misses, that's why I got all you bitches
Don't take it personal baby, 'cause everything is big business
It's either kill or be killed
It's either plantinum or gold

Say you hot if you cold
I thought I told you never trust a busta that's on the loose
Loose enough to send you fallin' without no parachute

Come in just 2 years from now
Teach us to give orders
That the ones that's sellin' shit, the fit is here, she started
Get departed early baby, for some shit, I'm so sorry
To be tellin' you I see the signs of triggers & blood
That was bum-rushed by thugs, intoxicated with drugs
Not to be auspicious to ya by a nigga named Paul
Now lyrics come from who watches over us all
Lucifer, the light barrier
Lucifer, the sun of morning
Is it he who bares us light
Down at night, I hear you callin'
Light will overcome the darkness
Can't you see that's bein' real
Give us something you can feel

Once we get the shit we vamp back to the cut and start to chief
Drinkin' Tanqueray and smokin' hay while watchin' some TV
Pass the fuckin' blunt or better yet, let me get a gun
Damn this shit some fire, my eyes are red

First of all: you came too wrong
Second of all: you blew my high
Nigga don't you ever be a victim of this fuckin' shit

""Yeah let's smoke one bitch""
When I hit the masters I do this shit just how I fuckin' wanna
Do this shit real slow, not fast, fill me up with marijuana
As I inhale the smoke I start to choke but I don't give a fuck
High as hell, can't you tell? But damn I'm just not high enough
I just love to smoke, I like the way it feels to get real high
Listening to some pimpin'
As I roll me up some more of that fire
I don't undastand these bitches
That be scared to hit that dope
Crack the one that kills
The weed fulfill your every need, so smoke
Weed is what you need
To keep you crunk up in this world today
Best believe I stay cr-izz-unk
Cause cloud 9 bitch is where I stay
Gangsta Boo don't give a fuck about a nigga with that shit

Stayed up in the club, fresh to death, in the gucci set
He was tryna get his act straight, so he turned to rap
He was tryna sell his last ounce, then out comes the gat

Where my real niggas at?
Everybody fuck with Boo

I dropped out of school
But still had a Caddy truck
In the studio with Triple fucking Six

Verse 2
Hung with the dope boys on a hot ass street
Called Eldridge Hollywood, North Memphis Tennessee
Where they deep
Niggas be packing that heat
Sometimes I couldn't even sleep
Cause of the them bombs
Niggas was bussing them guns
I guess they just wanted to eat cool
But I had something else to do
I wrote a fucking rap or two
Then I moved up out the hood
And took a fucking flight or two
Acting like you know me
Ain't gone help you when my patience up
I was always taught them niggas ain't tough
You get into some Gangsta stuff
We don't play with other folks kids
We get it how we live
Gold grills and we trill
Disciples in the house

The underground rap muthafucka

Havin' suicidal thoughts
Oops, I love you too much
You just don't know what you be doin' when I'm feelin' yo' touch
Get to schemin, play a role, like I'm in a soap opera
Findin' bitches number in yo' wallet, and how I'mma stop it
(What should I do?) Go bother the niggas that is down wit yo' crew
]From me to you, this Gangsta Boo, and I'm just tellin' the truth
You hurt me bad, feelin' strange, wit revenge on my mind
Call my baby from the 8 and say ""it's been a long time""
How are ya doin'? (Doin' great)
I got problems on mind
This nigga told me that he love me, but I guess he's a liar
Somebody, bye bitch nigga, I'mma get yo' ass back

This is givin' me asistance in committin' adultery in the late night
Makin' love 'til ya had me where I couldn't concentrate right
Hypnotizin' my thought process wit love,  ? & venom
Prepared to kill for you, I fold, make sure pistol that pin 'em
Though you be wit it, this affair is too good to be true
It must be blessed
Besides, yo' man is too posessive & over-protective
You want him deceased, I'll be da trigga man on the piece
After it's over, you & I can have an intimate feast
Let me know the time & location plus how to do it
You told me 12 at yo' house, sliced & least dilluted
So I'm creepin' to the doorstep of your 30 million mansion
It's time fo' havoc, ???,  he'll be evicted on the fuckin' minute
You been takin' shovin' & orders
He bust & you're a torch

Like his ass locked up hell tight
I sexed him down once he ate his food, this was like right
After the clock struck 9, 12 on midnight, he finished
Cuz my baby Paco wanna blow his brains on the ceiling
Hope his folks don't be mad
Fuck it! I just might flee
Because he left a lot of money in the S-A-F-E
Too good to be true
Gangsta Boo love somebody

Gotta believe in the God of Black

You better believe in the God of Black

Inhaled the weed smoke, forgot all my problems
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't a part of it
I'm a goddess, so I be with the gods
If he ain't affiliated with some king shit, I'm breaking his heart
Gotta respect the G code, that's 24-7
Niggas don't, that's why they snitching and telling
Fake jewelry and fake clothes, they want the life
Do anything to get it -- to me, that shit is so trife
They even bite the hand that fed them breakfast
Dishonor at it's best
It's mostly all these bitches who be wishing you your best

Pockets bail matches on her own legs
I'm livin' like the fuckin' queen
With my money I made
I got to let my nigga know before the news hit the block
That this bitch done told the Feds he was pushing them rocks
So what to do, what to do to this bitch ass snitch
She played up on my fuckin' nigga
He wasn't giving them dick
I grab my keys, get to the car
Balling to a pay phone
To call up Paul at home to get a couple of them tones
Let me see, where would she be
Hmm, is it really hard to tell
She knows the Mafia well
She knows that we gonna send her straight to hell
But I'll call down, be low key
Like I really don't know
I stay at home, stop my shipment so I won't go for broke
Someone had wanted to see us fall
But we staying on the top
We beat the playas that be balling cause the party don't stop

Bitch you know I'm lookin good, on the block posted up
Icy white reeboks throwin Triple Six up
In the air I don't care, you see Billboards playa
Platinum billboards in the hood of you playa haters
Try to sneak up in the club low key, f**k an autograph
Dog I'm tryna chill, you can catch me in the aftermath
I ain't tryna brag or say I'm all that, when I'm not
But I'm fuckin bad, I'm knockin plenty bitches out the spot
I was always told that my pussy be the f**kin best
If you want to test let me put your nigga on some X
If you want to fuck let me see who money spend the best
Eight figure dick be the best nigga nuttin less
Niggas round town actin like they f**ked the Gangsta Boo
Hoes round town sayin did she f**k my man too?
Yo I'm runnin shit niggas gave me crown, labeled me the queen
Gonna do this damn thing bitch, know what I f**kin mean
If you niggas good and hi let me see you clap your hands
If you niggas good and drunk let me see you clap your hands

Yean ain't do no ten twenty years in the pen nigga
Flaugin ass boy wit you mug on like you hard
Boy you need to stop yean neva had a f**kin charge
You a momma's boy Gangsta Boo went to school with you

Wit cha girlfriend with her jealous ass on the scene
Black ass bitch blue long braids bitch please
It's about time that I told you
I don't care if you bitches dont speak, i don't love you
Listen to the rumors called the story crazy lady boo
Got my nigga rollin blunts and smokin to get f**ked up
I know you gon hate when you see me comin on them thangs
Pullin in the gated driveway cause I'm havin thangs
Still I'll bust a cap if I catch you on surveillance
Two killaz on the roof
Bulletproof
We don't love you
If you niggas good and hi let me see you clap your hands
If you niggas good and drunk let me see you clap your hands
Why I'm devoted to this game
Where they slang
And they gangbang
North North mayn
Wit them curls and them gold thangs
Lemons wanna step to a playa wit these lame names
Knowin they dont wannat come to our side buckin brains
20 thousand cash to my nigga, nigga
Kill this bitch
Heat on them leather seats lets get into some gangsta shit
See the boy walkin down the street
Grab him by his neck
Point him with the tec what's your set
Leave his body wet

When ya broke they disgrace you
When you all then they hate ya
On my wrist it’s a glacier
Bought that bitch with some paper
Mashin’ and I’m killin’ these bitches
Hustle gang truly forgiveness
Witness how I be turnin’ these posture bricks
Main solo, I don’t need no pickin’ shit
I’m mashed out in my drop-top
I got my broad-top on and my bank account on me
Most of you hoes be fallin’ really on me in my business
Tryna act like you my homies
Made, I got it made, later threw the shade
I got 100 ways that I can get payed
They already know, if they wanna see the gangsta
They gon’ have to come up with a whole lotta fuckin’ paper
I read it through the dirt, I buy myself
Fuckin’ with the bosses, why ya fuckin’ with the help?
I’m mashed out with the wrist out
Cuz I been gettin’ money where the knowledge is ?
I be mashin’, I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper
I be mashin’, I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper

I be mashin’, I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper
When ya broke they disgrace you, when you all then they hate ya
On my wrist it’s a glacier, bought that bitch with some paper
If they broke, they don’t ask for no phone-call
Call me like I neva sold 1 million records, y’all
I’m yo bitch, I’m yo bu, pullin’ up in Beverly Hills
Music loud in the Coupe, valet tellin’ me to chill
I am a gangsta fo’ real, been askin’ you bitches to quit it
Please, you snitch then you go
We all know that you did it cuz you were quittin’
Leave, niggas be still in my flow
Tryna treat me in my flow and it’s all funny
Cuz you bitches secretly hatin’ for bein’ in my shows
Bad trick, I am the shit
Mashin’ and dashin’ for what I’mma get
You play in the lane while I’m makin’ hits
I’m walkin’ on sand; I’m rich as a bitch
When I be broke, they don’t answer the phone
When I’m on tour, I be missin’ my home
Gate is protected and gated by drones
Always on point cuz I stay in my zone
I be mashin’, I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper
I be mashin’, I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper
When ya broke they disgrace you, when you all then they hate ya

Titties sitting up like plums, won't you come suck on one?
Ass got a jiggle jiggle, when I walk, it wiggle wiggle
Looking in the mearor, like damn, booty getting bigger
Hell yeah, booty looking stuffed, just like a teddy bear

Come and taste a little bit, you gon' want a lot of it
Standing like a stallion in stilettos, for the fuck of it

You just wanna take a picture of my booty, when it switch

Watch niggas crumble up like foil

So as long as I breathe, I bet a stranger won't eat

30 racks for a  my trap house buncking
Chicken, chicken, my trap house buncking

Trap house buncking, booming out the frame
Got a couple neighbors, and they all say the same thing
Everybody want some, got the best work in town

Finger licking good,  bitch, chicken season

Moves that I'm making gon' determine my wealth
I know that you be watching, tryna learn my two steps
I ain't got a lot of friends, I can count them on one hand
Count my pay up with my weight up, fuck these pussys like a man
Been an underground legend, even if I don't clame it
It's a shame that you be mad, Ms.  made it
You bitches ain't paying no doos, why y'all hating on Chat and Boo?
Doing this shit so goddamn long, bitch, our time is overdo

But played my heart like a motherfuckin toy
It didn’t matter, I was in
Took him back again and again
Then this nigga had fucked my friend
Bitch wasn’t straight but that’s how it all begins
I thought we was cool, but we wasn’t
We just grew apart like we’re cousins
So when I saw her it was nothing
She tried to tell me that the nigga had dumped her
I was crying cause I ain’t a talker
I’m looking at this hoe like she a motherfuckin staller
So I asked her will she rob him?
She said “Yes, I’m the best”
Provin that you can’t be trustin bitches in the street shit
Now since you done crossed me, Imma set yo ass up
Since you wanna fuck my friend
We gone pluck you like a duck

Ain’t no love in my heart put this pistol to ya front

In my mind, just because I am—
I was an original group member of Three 6 Mafia
It should always be looked at just like that
Three 6 ain’t two people, Three 6 just ain’t DJ Paul and Juicy J
Three 6 is Three Six Mafia. It was Six people
Crunchy, Paul, Boo, Juicy, Lord, and Koop
Everyone else that came after was just a part of the collective and should only represent Hypnotize Minds, which was then “MAFIA!” and shit like that
Three 6 was a GROUP, shit wasn’t like no Temptations
And that’s why the fans are so confused
They don’t know, is Three 6 two people? Three people? Four people? Five people? Or six people?
The original Three 6 Mafia is: Paul, Boo, Koop, Crunchy, Lord, and Juice. That’s it
It’s in the books, it’s on the internet
You cannot rewrite history
And when muhfuckas bring the Three 6 Mafia, they can’t forget the First Lady, the first one to have a solo album on a nationwide label
And that’s— like, I was that bitch!
And muhfuckas better not ever forget that shit
Because if they do, it’s gonna be a muhfuckin problem and I’m gonna keep taking that shit just like a Three 6 Mafia bitch would

36013,Mia X,Da Payback,"tonight to settle the score
Females are women and girls, not bitches and hoes
To all the niggas that's stunting off the weak-ass rhymes
It's payback time
So what up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up
Lick up, suck up, get up, pay up
Get up, what up, what up, what up
Niggas all around that's dissing the women
I came to get you straight cause I mean it yes to win it
I tried to let you slide, but now I'm getting pissed
Mia X is in effect so don't be starting no shit
Now, ""Suck a nigga dick for an outfit""?
And, ""Suck a nigga dick for some K-Swiss""?
Well, eat a lady's pussy for a home-cooked meal
And blow the ass for a 40, bitch
Lying on your dick non-stop
That's something that a woman just crams to understand
You ain't seen no guts, don't get no guts
The closest thing to some pussy is your hand
""Biggity-bounce, baby, bounce""? Bitch, I ain't no ball
You get excited if I ride it, but your dick too small
Doing damage to my backbone? Please!
You're barely tickling the walls -- bitch, you're just a tease
And make my pussy scream for a six-inch dick?
I'm pushing eight-pound babies, so you talking shit
Ride that dick with a boot in my mouth?
You get the gat for the cat cause I wear your ass out
Leave your mind without a clue, thoughts without a trace
Just waiting for a turn for the pussy in your face
You said the pussy wasn't nothing but meat on the bone
Til you took a little stroll in a comfort zone
Nigga, stop talking that shit
You can't wear a pussy out with that weak-ass dick
I say nigga, stop talking that shit
You can't wear a pussy out with that weak-ass dick
Now why your dick so small?
Cause your nuts look like chiny balls, bitch
Now why your dick so small?
Cause your nuts look like chiny balls
Well, I didn't get no nut, nigga
So you can't get your fucking hair cut, nigga
I say, I didn't get no nut
So you can't get your fucking hair cut
I met this nigga, his name was Duke
The bitch tried to take me to the Rochambeau
I said, ""Cheap motherfucker, better come again
And let's mosey on over to La Quinta Inn""
When we got in the room, he started to stunt
He said, ""I'ma bring the noise to your little cunt""
So when he pulled down his pants and introduced me to cat
All I could say is, ""Where it's at, where it's at""
The dick was small, he had no balls
I said, ""You ain't doing damage, no damage at all
Lay back and let me do that right""
I made him shake, shiver, scream, wiggle, moan, and cry
You know, the nigga couldn't hang like I already knew
Made him pay me three bills, took the car keys too
Pulled up and blowed for Bunny and Mice
Rolled through the Calliope, wasn't nothing nice
A nigga said he was starving, needed his hair cut
Well, get on your knees and lick this butt
Hardcore is what I am, coming at you correct
Cause niggas ain't worth the blood on your Kotex
Oops oops, got some hair in your teeth, bitch
You graduated from tits and now you're sucking clits
Oops oops, got some hair in your teeth, bitch
You graduated from tits and now you're sucking clits
Shake for the Third Ward, shake for the Fourth Ward
Shake and take his money
I said, shake for the Sixth Ward, shake for the Seventh Ward
Make him lick that honey
Shake for the Eighth Ward, shake for the Ninth Ward
Shake it girl, shake shake shake
Or just shake for the Tenth Ward, shake for the Twelfth
Let them put the dick it's in an earthquake
Shake for Hollygrove, shake for the West Bank
Shake for the projects too
Hop for your neighborhood, hop for New Orleans
Know the rough hunting niggas, this for you
I ain't popping for no stunters, I use my head
And pop this pussy for a mink instead
I don't want no Shoney's or Denny's
But we could wine and dine at Copeland's, please
I don't need four golds in my mouth
But you can put Louis the Fourteenth in my house
I want a herringbone set and I want a purse
Bitch, I want to do me in verse
Met another nigga but he didn't like rubbers
(What?!) So he couldn't be my lover
Practice safe sex and keep the coochie clean
Because a nigga might turn your shits purple and green
And all you niggas out there claiming you don't eat
Everybody knows that that's a L-I-E
But since your ass do lie, I wish your nose did grow
Cause it would please me much better than what you got below
So where they at, get the gat and bounce baby to this
Uh, real woman shit
Niggety-niggety-nigga, I need some gear
So hustle that money and bring it here
And niggety-niggety-nigga, you better move fast
Bring me that Explorer filled up with gas
And make sure it's clean when I rep
So don't give me no-no-no don't give me carpet no sack(?)
And if I meet another nigga bumping in his shit
The pussy-ass nigga gotta deal with it
Cause ain't no nigga like a trick daddy nigga
Cause a tight motherfucker ain't shit
So if you squeak when you walk, you ain't legit
And you better just get on, bitch
All the ladies say, ain't no nigga like a trick daddy nigga
Cause a tight motherfucker ain't shit
So if you squeak when you walk, you ain't legit
And you better just get on, bitch
Now, this young nigga, he had a Benz
He had a pocket full of ends
So I pussy-whipped that ding-a-ling-ding
Cause I'mma get paid for doing my thing
Call me a bitch, or even a slut
But nigga, you know you paid for the guts
So talk that shit with your fake punk ass
But don't forget to tell them how you tricked that cash
What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up
Lick up, suck up, get up, pay up
Get up, trick up, what up, get up, what up
The Uptown women, they hauling fast
And quick to knock a motherfucker on his ass
The Downtown women got poison taste
You could smell our perfume when we walk in the place
Sassy and classy, but don't forget
With the blink of a eye, we'll handle a bitch
No medallion earrings, that's played-out shit
A bitch is down for a car and a tennis bracelet
I want Venaditi, not Polo
I want DKNY, and not Girbaud
I want Anne Klein tennis, bitch, not K-Swiss
So nigga, get on the corner and sling that shit
And if your ass get shot, that's what you get
But motherfucker, I want the disability check
Now, you could say that's cold, but that's the way it is
You gotta show a nigga that you're all about biz
I don't feel sorry when it comes to ends
I'll leave your ass for three days in a shitty Depends
Now that you're paralyzed, do what I told you to
And make that tongue work for you

All ya'll niggas in Baton Rouge. (It's MP, MP! MP)
Shreveport. (the muthafuckin colonel)
Alabama. (The Colonel!)
Kansas. And it's time to salute. (At ease!)
North Carolina. South Carolina
The first muthafuckin lady of the tank!
(on the muthafuckin tank!) The tank! (Feel this!)
Detroit. The hardest bitch you ever heard!
(the hardest bitch you ever heard) D.C. (Uuunnnggghhh) Mia X!
(Mia X!) Mia X! Unlady Like! (Unlady Like!) Unlady Like!
You don't wanna, go to war with a soldier
No Limit, TRU nigga, I thought I told ya!
Mamma! Four star lady general, picture the tank
I represent, get ya bucked, and I ain't to be fucked with
Nigga, lyrical, lyrical, ghetto she-devil
Below the sea level (New Orleans) chills the illest sista
Quick to get ya tangled in my web of gangsta pictures
Descriptive vocals, who's the black widow I flow to
Red Sea, flooded the rap in the streets, started the week
And got my props in and out of bloody cheddar cheese
Betta keep yo negativity about No Limit on the under
My verbal warfare will shake that ass like thunder
I thunder, man, they wanna be bad hoes, so ask yo-self
Can you handle any physical encounters with moi?
Huh? My thug entourage lives for rollin them blunts
Totin them guns, tearin shit up, what?
There is no street bitch, rollin with niggas
Flowin with niggas, holdin they own with niggas
Like Mama Mia, and her kid sista
Lady Smith and Wesson, 9 milli-heata splitta
Forever with the, TRU soldiers, till I die
We gon ride, smoke weed, and drop lyrical keys
??? Reebok, laced up, strapped with my hardhat
Army fatigues, strapped, and I'm ready for combat
Fool, I got that ghetto sold like ?Lebanon?
And P be the commander, chief, call me the black Sylvester Stallone
Eyes ever red, cause I'm gon off that dolja
Raise ya guns high if you a No Limit Soldier
Fool, till I die, I'm a represent the tank
A colonel's any nigga in the ghetto makin bank
Gats cocked for hatas, suckas can't fade us
Got niggas representin from Louis, Florida, to Vegas
Mississippi to Oklahoma, New Orleans to California
Cleveland, Ohio, Atlanta to Tacoma
Texas, Evansville, to fuck it, Indianapolis, Augusta
Niggas rowdy, just bout that cabbage
Gats TRUed up, gon off that green and hennesy
Like Pac say, fool, keep ya fuckin eyes on ya enemies
I be dunkin niggas in the hood just like Stackhouse
I'm known, any nigga in the ghetto
Could say ""ungh!"" and watch hoes pass out
Bitch I'm breakin bread with muthafuckin killas
And I'm slangin tapes, to muthafuckin drug dealas
And I'm representin, No Limit to the fullest
TRU nigga till I'm dead, gimme the trigga, I'm gon pull it
Nigga pass the weed, cause I'm bout to get high
And hatas watch ya ass, cause ya ass is gonna die
We be No Limit niggas, and we bout it
We come to a club, and get the muthafucka rowdy
Bitch, I'm TRUed up, cause I'm in it
P is the colonel, I'm the muthafuckin lieutenant
Soldiers
Ya'll don't wanna go to war
Cause I'm off the muthafuckin tank, bitch
Ya'll think ya'll could, ya'll can't hang
Bitch, I'm a tell ya as a fact, ya'll can't, bitch
Military mind, or should I say military schemes
Count my fly radio ??? pull a hit off in the daytime without bein seen
Cause I'm a N-O, L-I, M-I-T soldier
I tried and told ya, fuck repeatin myself over
Niggas start runnin, I start bustin, niggas be hidin and duckin
You could be off and rushin, I got problems still can touch ya
Nigga fuck ya, no bustas, just soldiers and hustlas
I'm good with my gun, but if it jams I resort to my knuckles
Cause if you ain't a soldier, then you ain't shit
And if you ain't a soldier, then what's yo purpose, bitch?
Together we make more noise than clash of the titans
Bring mo game than we fightin
I done hooked up with the Colonel, give a fuck if you like it
Keepin bitches excited, recycle hatas that trifle
Get vital with rivals, got hoes awaitin my arrival
Call them people for me, I'm on fire
Scorchin hot, rhyme thrower, if yo ass get burned, don't hold me liable
We move far, can't go to war past 16 toys
You know who we are, we No Limit Soldiers we step when we march
I want yo respect like a direct order from ?Freestar?
Niggas get scared when I come through, bitch, I'm expectin five stars
Bitch ??? never overload rounds to be shot
We mercenary soldiers, we can't be stopped!
Bitch, we soldiers!

Soldier, soldier (about face, at ease)

Yeah you know respect who I am
Cause if you mess with me I'll take ya man
Well I'll take ya man right out your crib
And make him do the shit for me that he never did
So when you see us together perfing in the place
Super shocked, got the dick look on your face
Go head roll your eyes, talk some shit
But you ain't bad enough to get em up with this bitch
Now you can call me a raw man stealing hoe
But I couldn't take you nigga unless he's ready to go
You know what's up
I'm all about chin checks
Mia X gets wrecked on dumb young ??
Like you fucked the rest of your crew

You know who I am
Fake bitch don't play me close
Cause I'll take yo man

Ya fiancee your husband
The niggas you sweating and all your fuck friends
And when I say I will you know I can
Don't fuck with me
Cause I'll take yo man

Its not a bet or a threat
Its a damn promise
From me to you
Think you the shit
I send him back with the news that he's pussy whipped
And packing all his shit
You thought you had that locked
But now I push his Lex truck up and down the block
Cheddar knots, ice rocks, hands get frost bite
Shopping sprees to Loisviller after just one night
Nothing nice, boss skills in the b-e-d
Close your shop once my legs spread a quarter to three
The biggest Mama sippin Mo
Still running the show
Got your man on a mission body ?? my dough
Hoe you don't know if ya coming or going
Look at you face, the jealousy's glowing
And showing, don't player hate
Get your shit tight
I flow bolo so so unladylike
On the mic think twice this bitch ain't no joke
I'll stomp your ass like a southern cockroach
For short, I'm the hoe who spoiled your wedding plan
Peep us walk hand in hand bitch

And when I say I will you know I can
Don't fuck with me
Cause I'll take yo man

Cause you's amongst a many bitches that I do not like
But I really don't want him
That nigga just a rep hunter
I'm only doing it to get up under
Yo skin, show you that your nigga dicking
Me, talking bout the things he can do for me
Please me, spoil me rotten
The feelings that he had for you they are forgotten
While I'm plotting on the Swiss and the cheddar
The better bitch
The clever bitch that any weather shit together bitch
Handles your nigga like a rookie
Got his mind got his money
Got his face in my pussy
A licky licky
Ride him like a pony
Act a fool his dick don't get hard for you
No more whore got you with a headache
Blowing up his pager trying to plead your case
To late ya x'd out its best you understand
You ain't shit no more
I got yo man

Ya fiancee your husband

Man, check him out you see what I mean
Tricking all this cream

Its so easy to get involved with this sister
Ain't no ifs or buts, ask your nigga
Pussy be the bomb, cause my game is cool
It's not speculation
Your nigga said so
Revenge is sweet, but payback's a trip
Dumb bitch, you won't know which is which
But I'll tell you this

Better rimes and bring skills I will
Keep it locked,word to my moms dredlocks
Some nights I just wanna set the party on top
Wit' P and the Ill Na Na,unified hip hop
Mo' chedda as long as the party don't stop

Shakin' it to the west
Throw it up northside
And the south gonna handle the rest

I tried to feed you everything you needed
And if I wrote I love you in the sky, you probably wouldn't read it
Cause, you actin like it don't even matter no more
Sometimes, I feel we in a race, tryin to make it to the door
Is it that I bore you, is it someone else again?
Should we put this to an end, and maybe start again as friends
I'm tryin to be mature, but mentally, I'm so tired
And you can't even tell me why
I cry feelin stupid, used and alone
When it's four in the mornin and you still not home
Where did we go wrong, it used to be all gravy
Makin love all night, callin me your baby
But things got shady, now we ain't even close
Treat me like I should leave, and then don't want me to go

I'm tryin to hold on, cause what we had was so deep
And in relationships, you got to take the bitter with the sweet
You keep runnin in and out, messin with my feelings
Playin with my mind and I know you see me trying
But even soldiers fall, remember when you fell
Remember the excuses and the lies I had to tell
?Put penance? for your bail, even though you gave me hell
When you was snortin more than half of what you had to sell
Put up with all your flings, hold my head, feelin sad
But through all the bull, you know it wasn't that bad
You used to make me laugh, show me love and respect
But if you don't make a change, you'll be callin me your ex

Gator skin boots and purses for my slick verses

I lie if I have to even cry if I have to

No rushin' I make sling it all then bring it all to me

Cause you gon' need to bust about three or four nuts, no speedys
Cook the breakfast and the flowers only
He gon' comeback knowin' where the safe's at
And he gon' take that and bring it on to mama
Send me off to relax, with my girls in the Bahamas
Sipping pina coladas
And I'ma be on the sand, plotting on his friends
Especially the dark one with the six-hundred Benz
His ends is long, he say he don't buy me shit
Two weeks later, that same nigga, I was driving his shit
With the keys to his crib, Prada full of his G's
Knew the secret hiding place for the China and weed
All my need he's trying to fulfill
Wanna be my number one, every time I make him come
It's like the boy gets dumber and dumber
Cause mama say I got him under a gree-gree
Take me shopping in New York, let them repossess her car, unladylike

Well let em have it  x2
You wanted drama so mama came squeezin shit, passin out clips
Bustin domes, rippin flesh, exposing bones and yes
I bring that, sending G's out barrel at ya, duck and run
Now how far you think you really gettin with this infared on my fuckin gun
Now workin for funds and I ain't the one hour hoe (for real)
But I love to show where it's been tell your body so
Look out for the riders open slider bitch from the TRU click

Them bitches doubt I'm bout testin niggas nuts
Alias in jacks we trust I'm known for shankin up
Ranking up lyrically with the best MC's
Cause ain't no studio up in me, real niggas feel these
See Mia X is known for bringin wreck on top
Too hard for the beats you niggas drop

Got the trigger hap temper and the Fiend four sons
A lyrical fiend at it's best and you bitches don't want none

The colonel gave me permission, Mama drama pass the word to her youngin
Ask how I'm comin and will it get them haters runnin
I ask do rats sleep in dungeons? Is Victor Newman cunning?
Do quick bullets get to hummin, damn right I'll bring the gun in
Get done in like a knife at a gunfight cause I ain't right
Keepin dope, smokin pipes, like a height cause I'm high as a kite
I'm cryin to fight, I'm a swing with my might, my fist balled tight
Man get it right, somebody best die tonight
Somethin have drama came and as drama came then, then came murder
Fuck your home I want your dome, call me your soul burgular
Have you heard of a shocker server, takin weed to his trunk
Bullets pump, and his cockin bad and louder then his womp womp
When I play it I say it, suck one nigga if yous the man

Yo, I'm Silkk the Shocker, know I'm saying?
Everybody's like if they ever meet me
They'll do to me, come on, NOT!!!
But I'm looking for somebody who could teach me
Something I don't even know, for real
Know I'm saying?
Yo, yo, yo, imagine this, flash my wrist
When I grab you, miss
Do everything, but if I forget something, ask me
Trying to do it til you're happy
You're a teacher, so teach me, when I make it to school
I'ma stay in detention for a while `cause I'm a thug so usually I
Break a few rules
Imagine pleasure from night time, fin to get sun in
Uh huh, receiving gifts, never ever have to trip on no money
So when you need me, know where to reach me
Beep me if you wanna get freaky
I know a lot, a few things you could teach me about sex
Sex is something when your body is pumping, thumping
Sex is something when your body is thumping
Sex is something when your body is bumping, bumping
Sex is something when your body is thumping
(repeat twice)
Welcome to the school of professionals
We can get it soaking wet while you get us going
Anything goes when it's easy to score
There won't be a move and you can't ignore
So here's your lover, instructor today
Any questions you may have after class, I'll demonstrate
And we'll take it slow, and when it starts to drip
Just sip and let it flow
While I undress you, I caress you, show you how I test you
And along with your body, I recognize, gotdamn pretty brown eyes
Allow me to sex educate you as I roll baby all through the night
Mama is the best teacher
Certified in opening wide, guaranteed to please ya
Mia, that southern diva
Keeps you hotter than grandma's heater
Be the one you call when you want your toes to curl
]From my up and down, and my round and round
But remember I'm a rodeo girl
And I fulfill your dreams, I know you know what I mean
Legs spread like 9:15
I rip this thing so mean, bout it bout it, no doubt
Have you sweating like a Jane Fonda workout
Put the lights out, we done had enough mirror time
Now we bout to get down and dirty
Deeper, daddy, harder, do your thing `cause it don't hurt me
Work me and I'ma work you, put my lips on that thing too
Deepthroat and never ever ever choking
Make you swear you're seeing stars boo
We ain't through, it's a all night thing
Just ride thin til the cops come knocking
Like that, I don't take no slack
I am to please, and all my students come back
Know I'm saying, the only thing you could teach me must be sex
Huh, well, let's get class on and go to work

Click tight, for life, family ties
That's right. It's bigger than this record shit, nigga
All for one and one for all, that's how we ball
TRU, forever, that's my family
We be's on top the cheddar pile
Wet you up like the Nile
Enemies bleed in wartime, illicit rhymes
Illustrated crimes, pucker up, kiss my 9
Mia's kid sister, buckin misters and misses for figures
Trick ya, we set ya up and then we get ya
It's the biggest mamma showin love to my sons and brothers
And we gon blow the roof right off this muthafucka
For the niggas ridin with this TRU click, it ain't No Limit
To my loyalty and strong arm authority
Admit it, I'm finna show day to day soap opera
Downtown hoes unload when we hold choppers knock ya
Head off in a split, put ya lips
Around this plastic dick, a Kodak moment
For this click, I don't mind dyin, takin a stand
In line, while bustin my 9
I'm tryin to show you through my verbal demonstration
We ain't bout fakin
We bringin home the cheese, greens, and the bacon
Takin no shorts and nothing that'll do
I'm representin, boo, mamma's 4ever TRU
I be's a TRU nigga till I'm dead (we bout it, bout it)
TRU soldiers ready to die (and rowdy, rowdy)
Put one in the chamber or that plastic Glock
I'm on the grind, that 3rd Ward, Calliope, pushin rocks
Gon off dolja, a No Limit soldier
Got love for killas and dealas and I told ya
But my homegirl is hella hard
Nigga, Master P, Silkk, Mia X, livin large
Gangbangin on this dope set
Smoke any nigga, bitch a click just like a cigarette
Now that's one to grow on
If you still bout it, bout it, muthafucka, bring yo bitch ass on
Cause we be bout killin, bout murder
Puttin muthafuckas in six feet girdles
Hustlin hard to pay the rent
Mamma cryin cause I know this don't make no fuckin sense
But I gotta clock cheese, to get my Gs
To stake my keys, to make OZs
Work in the project
An expedition in the house, note them pesos, we slang crack
TRU niggas stick together cause we ballin
One for all, if we fallin
I'm tatooed up (No Limit) and TRU to the game
Steady mobb'n, you muthafuckas know my name
Down for whatever at the drop of a dime
With my TRU niggas cautious on my rhyme, pick up my 9
Like that, but we be comin like this
Don't fuck with this click or ya might get lynched
Have your mama at the funeral, tissues, weepin
Due to the fact you got caught up in a street sweepin
No hesitation, you layin a stank
C-Murder will kill for any TRU soldier wearin a tank
We stick together like crazy glue
Ya'll read about the hatas tryin to infiltrate my fuckin crew
Bow down, and give No Lomit it's props
Gangsta rap pays the bills, sellin tapes, stopped sellin rocks
Breakin bread with muthafuckin ballas
P, C, Silkk, and Mia X, TRU shot callers
They asked me would take a bullet for ya homie
Ready to die for any stomach with a TRU tatoo on it
Get more support than a city after a hurricane
Radios and videos, now everybody know my name
We be ballin like the Dream Team in my crew
No Limit for life, and always 4ever TRU
4ever muthafuckin TRU, thought ya knew
Nigga, it's a must, it's a trust
If ya tell me what aim, I'm a bust
See one by one, niggas doin shows month by month
We ain't nothin nice
TRU niggas roll tight like fuckin blunts
Fuck them bustas that lookin for us
Nigga, we ain't hard to find
Fuck em, hidin, I'm probably makin a 500 SEL
With my convertible top down
And my cellular phone just ridin
Mia told me, represent
Watch out for niggas who muthafuckin phonies
Would you take a bullet for the president?
Nah, but I'd take a bullet for my TRU homie
I thought you knew, homie
Ya'll rappers tryin to be drug dealas and killas
We killas and drugs dealas turned rappers
Everything I know
Been got in for murder to muthafuckin kidnappin
Ya'll mad cause we hustle, ya'll ain't
Ya'll mad cause ya'll can't stack bank
I'm actin bad for the tank
Ya'll do what ya'll could, I'll do what ya'll can't

For everytime I'm puttin in work, add stripes to my rank

Don't a damn thing move until I hear ""mother, may I""

With dums dums baby, but you don't want none
Six sons indeed, they be The Baddest
Most Criminal, Serv-On and The Camoflauge Assassin
Actin up always bullets bringin tears
But you best not say shit about my kids, or you gets did
Lit up like Christmas trees
Wanna be mommy's understand who I am, the biggest of all
Runs my household and holds down your block
Open up shop, don't make me knock
Your dick in the dirt, I hurt, behind the cheese and the products
Faceless corpses found shot up from plastic toys
Yeah, we bout some funky noise
Eighty six Ma Parker and her boys, this is mama's family

Represent my No Limit click with my new nine
May I do mine
Represent my No Limit click (Mama Mia)
May I do mine
Represent my No Limit click with my new nine
May I do mine
Represent my No Limit click
With Fiend's Mr., watch me hit em, get em, for mama I'm a split em
And let my desert eagle lit em, til the family forget em
Kill em, pop ya, my guidelines are improper
Gettin bent ever since I was christened in vodka
Hand me my chopper, my bullets they penetrate
Fuck the money rate when Im as hungry as a Hatian
Mama may I forever stay high (fa sho), for safe keepin
Stay fiendin baby, cause I'm more devil then human being
Money schemin, supplying my workers with birds and dealing
Because mama understand that my hustlin has a meaning
The reason to stay passive ain't here no more
Addicted from havin it, from the ceiling to the floor
Fa sho and dedicated to my family chromosome
The Pope, come get it badder Fiend, now tell me the war zone
Black strong, puttin red dots on Uncle Sam
Continuin to be a bad man (bad man) and grams for Fiend
I said my mama was a rolling stone to the bone
Wherever she lays her piece of chrome is her home (there it is)
As long as she wants it to be there, bitch ass niggas beware
The spot where your standing I really wouldn't want to be there
Now see there, K dont pack fair
My little brother's a pair, standin straight over there
I get respect like Elliot Ness, so how you figure
Old punk ass, broke ass, bitch ass niggas
I brings drama like you spit on my mama
And before you think to steppin best done pause like a comma
Cause I done lays niggas down flat like that
Bitch on your stomach or back
So I don't wanna hear no bullshit
About my brothers that I roll with and my brothers that I pull hoes with
Cause it's a blessing to get this ass whoopin and a lesson
Now come and get this real session
Lesson one, never fuck with my mama or brothers
Two, buckshots flyin as we burn another
To the motherfuckin three, get somewhere when I get there
To the four, like I said before niggas I don't pack fair
Motherfuckers penny penchin'
I'm pushin a forty thousand dollar machine sittin on fuckin twenty inches
All paid out without a doubt
We rumble like the Bronx, and a bag that'll blow your fuckin back out
So mama I wanna get into some gangsta shit
But they don't wanna get into no gangsta shit
They all played out and they can't say shit
That's all I gotta say now mama that's it
Dear mama, they want your tubes tied cause your kids so gangstafied
We ride smokin that cannibus
Homicide, leave ya set hotter then pamper piss
Fuck scimilac, mama fi'n to jack
Mama taught me how to cook crack, if niggas bangin too then bang back
Cause that, I keep my gat close to hand
Niggas stuntin like Jackie Chan
I fill em with lead, leave em dead
With they head leaking like an oil can
For Christmas my list consists of nina
Two masks, two Glocks with extra clips and my favorite street sweeper
Look ma, I'm bout to bang this nigga, this fuckin pussy eater
Goin up my jaws, with breakin laws
Robbin niggas out they rocks at the bus stop, leave em standin in they
Drawers
Keep them hoes on all fours
Test me, you must be on them rocks like Pooky
Best learn the facts of life like Tootie
If we was in the pen nigga put it on your bootie
I used to watch cartoons while I'm breakin out keys in the backroom
At the table, boom, ten G's for little Kane, ten G's for Abel
Twin thugs down south, mama said knock you out
Congratulations, it's blood relations
Mama done gave birth to a brand new baby killer
Pass that nine rattlemiller nigga
Addicted to lead, fuck breasts, I was gun fed
Misled by Uncle Boz and Uncle Ed (family ties)
No beds so you can toss this dead bodys the smell born in hell
Mr. Bavgate, Mr. No Limit affiliate, Mr. retaliate
With a twelve gauge and a handshake
The baddest motherfucker east of the Mississippi
I'll bang ya for every letter in Kansas City
I can't spell, so Lord forgive me
Fuck goin to movies, she took me gun battles
And hid her dope in the baby rattle
Ain't no reg and nice meal and apple juice, kept my bowels loose
For my first birthday she gave a nigga a duece duece
So sincerely mama's number one, blast one for your oldest son
So now I lay me down to sleep
Fuck em, this family'll never live in peace
So if I bang one I hang one, mama's oldest son, nina
Dear mama, the youngest of us, bust quickly
Assassin, flashin in soldier fashion with the army action
Below the seas where the warm air breeze
Murder is disease, call it big ease, flooded with keys of China
Macadon put you on like revlon, them fake niggas get they rep on
I stack money like the Orientals, what's up to all them niggas that I'm kin to
To make a meal I'm bent to, mama said the rent's due
What's happenin, put them thug niggas on the map and
I represent like it's my first time rapping
What's the deal, keep it real and then real
The ill nigga feel, the blood spills on my army pantses
Buckin at the ambulances to my foes
Shots to his nose, I make sho' the casket is closed

I know I love mine

Now when we first met, my people really wasn't
Down for seeing me with a nigga who was thuggin
They told me you was trouble and wouldn't amount to shit
They said you'd hold me back
And give me plenty kids
They didn't even want to try and get to know you better

And moms was like whatever
But never in my life have I felt this way
And I know that this is right no matter what they say

Tryin to turn a dime into a dollar
You never to busy to holler
Askin bout my day my needs my feelings
Man enough to tell me what we got is realing
Toughing up my game, preparing me for these streets
Cause every brother don't treat every sister like a queen
You visualize my dreams and speak from your heart
Much love to my thug
Boo I hope we never part
Lets make it last forever
Through thick and thin and up and down
You have shown me love
So I'm gone be right by your side
Got much love for my thug
I remember when we got our very first little place
Not much furniture, but still we had each other
It was dead smack in the middle of the hood
But it was all good
Cause we be livin large once we could
But for now we was barely seeing pennies
I was waitin tables
And you was on the corner wild with them 20's
The land of plenty seemed so far away
But your bus rides and flights
Put it closer in eyesight
Long nights of cookin, cuttin and baggin
Kept your nerves bad and your eyes red and saggin
Staggerin in the door drunk
Pushin my accusations about them hoes
Time to flaunt I was sure you was messing around
We start to fight Even though I was wrong
You loved it when I stood my ground strong
That's why you kept me on your arm on your way up
My thug had me tight in his corner I got much love
Now, here we are plush cribs and cars
You hold the title of the newest ghetto star
You gotta watch you back
Cause them niggas out to jack
And you gotta guard my tracks
Cause them niggas kidnap
You even made me pack a baby nine in my purse
Took me to the shootin range
How to aim and where to hurt
Make they families feel the worse
Cause loosing me your biggest fears
You said you wasn't even trying to shed those tears
So now I here that your having your flings
I just laugh cause them broads will never wear my rings
Have my things and Most of all have your heart
We got the strongest ghetto love that will never part
So, when you fell I stood by your side
Took a stand in line Never let them break me Though they tried

And I ain't even trippin on you
Cause tha things you think is slick really ain't
You think you bein a playa
But looka here
Dude you can't
Cause I work everyday, but I dont pay nan bill
Sex you only when I want
And never do fix a meal
But on tha real
I be that pimpstriss, mackadame with game
Got tha mind playin
Met tha trick indeed to bring tha pain
Cause yo lame excuses
And yo tore up lies
Left you hanging wide open
And i ain't even tryin to cope wit
Yo mental cause it makes no sense
Thats why nothins goin on between us but tha rent
I spent alot of time tryna figure you out
But now I finally understand
You just can't trust no man
You can't trust a man ( why they always cheatin)
You can't trust a man ( why they mess up tha way they do)
You can't trust a man ( why they always cheatin)

Momma always told me dont nathin come free
They ain't shh
We knows how it goes
Always tryna come up on tha rolly hoes
But tha skys tha limit
I keeps my hmm sewed up
They backs up off tha hmm
Because I'm tryna make a buck

Packin junk in my trunk

That might even turn out to be more drastic
I'm mackin and he's ackin on his p's and q's
But fo how long fo real until I get tha blues again
I miss makin dinner fo 2
Candelight, bubble bath and tha rendevous
But I do know i ain't lettin him have his cake
And his ice cream while he eats his steak
I mean I ain't down to share no I can't understand
Some otha chick up in tha mix wit my man

Fucking with the nigga with the fucked up attitude and the bad pronunciation
That's why I come across rude, loud and obnoxious
Every other word gone be profane
Farting and spitting and grabbing my dick
Like I ain't got no fucking home training
Even if it's 5 o'clock in the morning
And the song ain't done, I ain't leaving
I'll take all day but when I finish the bitch
Have your head hurting and your ears bleeding
From having no money barely eating
Not going nowhere, rarely leaving
To steak and shrimp, every evening
Gone all day, busy as a beaver

A lyrical ruckus has erupted
And fucked wit' yo' manhood
When I get up and start bustin
Niggas just be like *ugh*
Get out my way, from this day on I put a dent in this shit
I know a lot of bitches thought it, but mama's endin' this shit
Been in this shit
My aim is to disfigure yo' style
And put it to sleep because the industry don't need no freaks
Meanwhile, my clique is settin' up shop on yo' block
And KLC got every car, bumpin' these ignorant knocks
Fuck them cops, and the mics, bitch I know my shit's tight
Just show us pain from the street, is what them niggas like
No half-steppin', my hooptie is a legend, shall we talk numbers?
Pull my bankbook out, and watch these figures stun ya, run ya
Why you niggas be lyin' on records?
Hoes barrin' marked hoes from D.O's to I don't know, but check it
Why y'all fakin' tha funk?
I raise my right hand trust, everything you see wit' No Limit
Belongs to us, let's get straight
Let's get it straight, you gon' know her when you see her
That's mama, the biggest mama, mama Mia
Now I'm unlady like, my verses hit yo' ears like Boo-Yah!!
I wear the pants in every freestyle stance with my verbal hoo-ride
Do I, ever slack up on that ass? Hell no
I threw the K well away, so it's so swell it stays so
What you know about me is just I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
And that our mob's T-R-U because they rowdy, rowdy, no doubt
Hey those beats, was meant for me like a cellmate
My brown lips fucked the piss out his 8-0-8
Drum kicks, and then they creep like TLC
And hella fast with O-Down, Mo B. Dick and Craig B
The beats, by the pound, nigga, best beware
Y'all ain't even comin' close to what they puttin' out there
My mama, got the drama, for any hoe, but mainly all
You Milli Vanilli hens who ain't got no pen better know
No Limit, I represent it, in a minute, to win it
With the gold and platinum finish
Let's get it straight
Late niggas be writin' all kinds of fucked up shit
About my family
P, Silkk, C, and my tank doggs, but we ain't even trippin
Punk critics, nah, you almost cryin', we'll buy up every
Publication and put you out a job, you still shy, everyday
Nigga think we can't?
Contemplate before you come to walk against a tank
I'm tellin' you one more gin', may have you where I want
But best keep hidin' behind them pen names cuz I know
You don't, wanna see us, because you wish, for a grant
You hit. One mo' time hoe, and yo' ass gon' meet the
Fish, of the M-I-Crooked letter-Crooked letter-I
Humpback, humpback, I ain't lyin
We on a mission, wit' nothin' but ebonics comin' through
Yo' system, flippin' rocks for phonics, but it's crime
Because you listenin
And you bob yo' head, better than a hooker, but yo' jealousy
Got you hatin' sayin' I woulda', they shoulda', they coulda what?!
We got the plat-screen property ebbin' us, but most of all
We still black owned and independent, let's get it straight!
Let's get it straight, you gon' know her when you see her
That's mama, the biggest mama, Mama Mia
Get it straight, you gon' know her when you see her
That's mama, the baddest mama, Mama Mia
Get it straight, you gon' know her when you see her
That's mama, the biggest, baddest mama, Mama Mia
Get it straight, Get it Straight!

36029,Mia X,Daddy,"Daddy Lyrics
This song is dedicated to all the responsible brothers other there
Whos how love and support to their children
I'd like to say thank you
Cuz I have a very important man in my life
He means the world to me
He helped make into the strong woman I am today
I'm talkin about my Daddy
I think back to the first time I messed up
You knew that I need to be
But you couldn't chastise me
Daddy's little girl
Most precious of all
You loved me more than anything
Your real life babydoll
Bounced me on your knee
Taught me how to throw my set up
Said you ain't got no brothers
Fight dirty
Don't take nothin
Saw you bustin your butt to keep the bills paid
Saw you hustlin for extras
For more pay you made a way
And tried to keep us happy up in the house
Cuz you wasn't tryin to see
Your queen or your princess pout
Doubtin out sometimes
But you tried to hide your pain
And be a tru playa in this white man's game
Never called my mama out of her name
Showed respect
Never put your hands on her
Even when she backed you in a corner
So Iwant to say you are appreciated
And this love song is dedicated to my daddy
Thank you Daddy
I know that I'm blessed
To have a father like you
Cuz you've done your best
Under so much stress in the crazy world
God knows you tried
Even when they got your hands tied
Remember when I came home seventeen and pregnant
And unexpectedly
But your disappointment never did show
You looked me in my teary eyes
Then you smiled
Put yoru arms around me
Said my baby's giving me a grandchild
Showed my boyfriend love too
Didn't come preachin or beefin
Just said you know what you gotta do
And when he didn't
You didn't rub it in
You just did his part
And tried to heal my young broken heart
I thought the things you said way back for certain
Was jus to try and keep me a virgin
But with all the hurtin and the drama I been through
I wish I would have listened to you
Cuz it was all true
Daddy the man who loves me unconditionally
Thru thick and thin
You'll always stand by me (fo sho)
Daddy I love you with all my heart
You're my souljah
My hero
My shining star
Thank you
I gotta give love to all the real strong brothers
Responsible daddies
Even if you're not with your baby's mothers
Your support
Your love and your time
Helps keep your children in the right frame of mind
And to the single fathers out there
Much respect
I'm a single parent too
So I know where you're at
And where you're coming from baby
But it's gonna get better
Hold your head through the stormy weather
And stand your ground firm
And all my sisters with good men at your side
It sure feels good to see the ??? family rise
I've cried joyful tears Happy as can be
To see man woman and child As one family
See the cards are stacked up against us y'all
So we gotta work it out Can't let em see us fall
But most of all Thank you God
Cuz for years I had an example of what a real man is
My daddy
Oh I wanna thank you for all you've done for me
I wanna thank you",595,,confident,0.900,"""['success', 'parental love', 'sacrifice']""",0.700,"{""id"": ""2krAQg3Muhytqn1mcuoGNU"", ""name"": ""Daddy"", ""album"": {""name"": ""Mama Drama""}, ""artists"": [{""id"": ""2d9xPZQzgCr6ObcDkUmjLu"", ""name"": ""Mia X""}], ""explicit"": true, ""popularity"": 3, ""duration_ms"": 252200, ""preview_url"": null, ""release_date"": ""1998-10-27"", ""external_urls"": {""spotify"": ""https://open.spotify.com/track/2krAQg3Muhytqn1mcuoGNU""}, ""migration_date"": ""2025-09-24T08:51:15.875560"", ""migrated_from_sqlite"": true}",2945,94,6.329787234042553,mia_x,chill,love,0.700

Who you trying to see bitch
Acting like you know me
You don't even wanta run up on this biggest mama don-es
Push the bomber shit out the back door
Crack, china and herb headed straight to the suburb
Ain't nothin changed but the route my Legend takes
To shake the crooks that's out to to stick me for my papes
I hate to make my hollow tips follow the red beam
But I can't let you hatas steal my dreams
I'm duckin sireens, daily
Cause crooked officers is known to take your
Cheddar cheese right up off of you
I'm warning ya
Flamboyant niggas and bitches, high-sidin them illicit riches
I bear witness to the way they kicked in the front door
Slam me on the floor, steel up against my temple
Beatin on my man and callin us outloud names
This type of shit ain't gonna never change
It's all in the game
Ghetto thang got my name ringin way in your hood
I'm paranoid but at the same time wishing you would
Test me
Cause you gonna get handled
Your corpse will dangle from a magnolia tree
As an example, I trample the many in my life time
I aints boastin, but if you cross me
Me and my niggas will be posted up, to tear shit up
Straight casket stuff
Nonstop cause we ain't trying to hear the word enough

Before thise Down South Hustlers invade your space and take it
We know you're hatin on us and wanta see us at the bottom
Plottin at the same time the fedz is watchin
Trying to catch something, but they can't
Why ya'll trying to bring a jeep to war against the tank
Just paint a cleaner picture about this family and you will see
Mama on the throne and soldiers kissin my finky ice
Nothin nice, full blown connects
Seen alot of blood spilled behind my family's respect
Check the rap sheets, they ain't hard to find
Attempt convictions but nothin stickin
Against this click
And the tru mission's almost complete
We about to have this industry at our feet
Slaughter the week and shine on all you envious hoes
I'm gettin mine while you knuckleheads is chasin fools
Those who got the nerve to spit viscious

You bitches can tell them niggas stop rightin your wrongs
Cause real bitches speak their own mind

36031,Mia X,RIP Jill,"Its not a day in my life that goes by
That I don't get high as the tears fill my eyes
And I scream why, did my sister have to die Lord
Take these evil plots off my mind Lord
Its not a day in my life that goes by
That I don't get high as the tears fill my eyes
And I scream why, did my sister have to die Lord
Take these evil plots off my mind Lord
It's so hard to say goodbye to what we had, I'm still mad
I'm still bitter, no still get rid of
Pain inside me been active two years
It's like it happened yesterday and I'm consumed in tears
I feel ya near
But it's not the same, won't be the same
We can't call each other up for advice or hang
No more, nigga to that left me with some memories
Tangled with the thoughts that he bleeds, dies slowly
For sholy, my needs to see him suffer fucks with my mind
And leaves a cluster of rage and hate inside
Thou shall not kill, an eye for an eye
Turn the other cheek, you reap what you sow, which way should I go
So many times I contemplate on murder
Cause only a monster could of hurt ya, you're a ghetto flower
So every hour, minute, second of the day
I pray that turmoil haunts his whole family, till eternal sleep
From the elderly to the unborn
You cannot know how I feel till you mourn how I've mourned
It's all real, I love hard and hate with a passion
So when they took my best friend, my heart shattered and left me empty
I used to had been in love
And all my niggas trying to figure out why it's so tough for me
To love em' like I'm supposed to
But since you got killed Jill it's hard for me to get close to
Anybody who cares for me, so I been dealing with this pain by my lonely
I strongly despise, motherfuckers trying to speak your mind
Whoever knew you, with pitchfork tongues spreading rumors
This dame ain't bout shit without my sister by my side
My strength, my best friend, my pride makes me wanna ride
Jill I know you got your wings, fixed hair up in Heaven
While Michelle sings ""Precious Love"", it's so hard for me to let go

Ya'll best to back the fuck on up
It's mama drama my nigga
I'm shiva with two heaters
See I'm hardcore my nigga for sure my nigga
Ain't never been scared before my nigga
Ghetto from head to toe
When I got some lyrical foe my nigga
The mics the fo fo when trigga
Launchin my verbal scatter
That shit ya'll do ain't worth the urine
Sticking in my bladder
The yappin and the chit chatter
Don't even matter cause nothins fatter
Than rapper's faces after I verbally gat ya
Beat em like they was Hagler
Rip em like no good paper
That's why they duckin Mia X
Hip hops new heavy weighter
The soldier hater, disentegrator, major paper maker
The gangsta rhymer, big timer
I'm Mama Drama
Chorus
Uhh, where my real niggas that we can ride us
How many soldiers down to do what they gotta
Like Mama Drama
Uhh, where my real bitches that we can ride us
How many soldiers down to do what they gotta
Like Mama Drama
Street date in all 51 states
They can't wait to hear my lyrical murder
The grim reaper, Mama Mia diva with the nerve ta
Sabotage ya'll, dressed in camouflage
Is my disguise daily
I'm a batterd woman thats surrounded
By them sharp kitchen knives baby
You gon realize that I ain't to be played with
I get payed with TRU, and I'm a made bitch
So what cha you wanna do, better call your crew
And tell em to come correct
But everything this way sho gon get Xed
Hexed I'm a voodoo mistress
Roots on all my lyrics, Ri Ri
Strong enough to make AMC
Don't fuck around, huff puff, then I blow em out
Then they all fall down now
They done told ya you gon know her when you see her
When you do, you gon pay me
Cause I come to do some damage
Have em frantic runnin to the table
With the record label sayin please would ya rap mine
Relief, hater she gon sit all in my face and gyrate
I'm irate, ain't no mistakes

Gangsta bitch rowdy rowdy TRU click
With that gangsta shit I'm bankin 6 figures

Who's got the industry hexed?
Well now, it's mama, full of marijuana
Headline nigga, whatcha' whatcha' want, huh?
You can see them niggas writin' rhymes
But don't need none, want some
Hoes run from these here
Who gon still be the boss bitch next year?
Who ain't gotta brag cuz the realness is there?
Who be havin' muthafuckas bucked everywhere?
When you think the biggest mama

36034,Mia X,You & Me,"Hey baby, I know you hear me
I wanna tell our story
It's painful but it has to be heard
Everybody sit back cause Mama Mia's gotta story to tell ya
And it goes a little something like this...
Now you and me didn't have a thing in common
Cause I was a quiet daddy's girl, music thug with no problems or drama
Ducking the laws and always facing some charge
Hustling hard and trying to stay on your guard
Oh Lord, how did we ever hook up
I'd ask myself but nothing really mattered but the feelings we felt
You hit below the belt when it came to ya niggas
But at the same time you knew the difference between biT.C.hes and sisters
I used to dig you way back, even though I played hard to get
Frustrated but at the same time your loving it
You never rushed it and put up with my teasing
And smacks to ya hands every time they start to creeping
Sneaking, out to see ya every chance I could
I knew this had to be love, because it felt good
Just to see ya do the simplest stuff like
Walk, talk, smile, even boot up, I couldn't get enough
Of being together constantly baby
The world revolved around you and me
Oh, yes indeed, ooh, yeah yeah
Reminiscing on my first steps to womanhood
And how you kissed away my tears and fears
Then laughed cause we could almost hear
My heartbeat, legs shaking, heavy breathing
Leading up to ecstasy cause I was getting used to you being
Inside of me, moans drowning out the pains in the streets
Whispering don't leave me, ya calling ya baby
Ya old lady, ya booT.C.hie boo
Caressing and hugging and exchanging I love yous
That's why ya trusted me so much and opened up
Even told me all the things that you had closed up
Inside, took me for rides in Texas and Florida
Trying to dodge the police and most of all the coroner
My innocence was long gone
If daddy only knew that I could breakdown and cut dope on my own
He'd flip and trip out cause I counted cheese faster than a bank teller
And didn't play him short, not ever, you and me
The world was ours, ooh
The motherfucking world was ours
Three years went by, and it was all about you and I
I heard the rumors about the others but they couldn't come close to the
Love we had and even made you a dad, a shining star
Proud, sticking out ya chest passing out cigars
Rolling hard, cash out the ass
But we have a baby now time to think about some staying plans
So-called friends are getting jealous cause we coming up
The grapevine said they talking bout running up
And I'm scared, I don't wanna see you dead
I'd rather give all this up, just to have you with us
But my pleas and cries couldn't slow ya down
I still see ya bloody body on the ground
I ain't the same, can't sleep wondering how it'd be
If we would've moved on and left this shit alone
You and me a true ghetto love story
That ended so sad and left my child without a dad
This is for all the women out there
Who think that being a hustler's lady
Is nothing but champagne, material things, and money
Then again much love to the dead and all the ones they left behind

Playaz meet me at the club cuz it's goin down
Master P got a party and you know we gone clown
It started at 10 ends when you leave
So I guess that's tomorrow if you party like me
I can't see the dancefloor cuz so many feet
But dead smack in the middle's where I'm trying to be
Valet got my Benz parked in VIP
No doubt that's the section for the cars all paid out
We in the house niggas screaming T-R-U
More ice on our bodies than an igloo
Can we get you anything to make you feel at home
All expenses on us
Get your eat and drink on
Money really ain't a thing
That's why the name's No Limit
Known for goin all out to have you all up in it
So let's get it started
And the real tru playaz gone shine at the party
Imma shine at the party
Sportin like 10 karats
Flex like seven figures
Me and all my niggas
Gettin jiggy in the club
All eyes on us
And as far as money goes
Yall know what's up
My girls mix hennessy with alize
We in full effect
Now we got that rowdy crowd
But all playaz ain't nobody tryin to get knocked out
The guys got the poker game goin on in the back
The ballaz baby the niggas with the briefcase kinda cake
High stakes fo sho head bustaz at the door
You can't look in without four figures or more
The place is like a fashion show
Everybody's feeling right
Big face Frank-i-lins falling from the sky
It is our mama first lady of the tank
Major crazy bank straight flossin think I ain't?

So my mind and this pain can drift away
Sometimes I love the rainy days
So my mind and this pain can drift away
Sometimes I love the rainy days
So my mind and this pain can drift away
Sometimes I love the rainy days
Tears from Heaven rain down and cleanse me
I'm out of control sometimes so much stuff's on my mind
I'm trying to find the right path to walk on
Maintain and be strong but I don't know how long
I can keep on, sleep on it
My partner said
And then nightmares of troubled times invade the space in my head
I'd rather be dead often than to deal with the pain and pressure
So let the rain fall and take it away all forever
But you can never be rid of troubled times
You can run away, try ot block it out but they gon' stay, stand firm
So we gotta learn how to deal with it
Look life in the eye be real with it (I'm trying)
I'm still getting bits and pieces of womanhood
Finally starting to realize that being grown ain't all good
I would rather be eight at my mom's place
Cuddled and sheltered from the pain
But for now I'ma leave it with the rain
Please let it rain before my man comes home
Maybe he'll wanna talk and practice between my thighs
Instead of on my eyes, while my
I going throught this I keep asking myself
Does somebody really love you, taking blows at you
Controlling you, and do you really love yourself
I don't know, it's like I can't think for myself anymore
I'm looking at the door, Lord please give me the courage to step
And if I do will I regret the day I left
Is he the best thing to ever happen to me
And is it a minor flaw when he leaves scars after beating me
Or can it be my self-eteem left with the first bruise
Lord, will I ever be a victim on the evening news, I'm so confused
I've got more blues than B.B
He keeps on pushing and hitting and shoving
And then claiming that he loves me
For life, trying to call me his wife
No rings of course
So can I give all this pain to the rain, let it pour
Will I ever, ever, ever in my ruggedy life
Live in a happy home and be a happy man's wife
No cheating, no fights, connected to wealth
And proud to look in the mirror and love myself
I think not, my hand full of dreams is all I got
One wishing that the rain could make it all stop
Top it off more, all the exit doors are locked
Click, change up got my brain detained and stained
What am I to do, Lord please talk to me
This bottle of Valiums keeps calling me
And he spoke, gave a sister award of hope
I'm bout to take my life back for sho'
No more, waiting for things to happen for me

t Blame Me Lyrics
Don't blame me for the pain the world has caused
Don't blame me for your own imperfectionate flaws
If every individual were to accept his own blame
I think the world would be a better change
A better change
Nigga don't blame me cause my lyrics hittin your chest like gunshots
And my thoughts seepin into your brain like cooked rocks
It's like a thick I have on a nigga mind is ??? yall
Sort of like ???????? of thugs
To break off from an overrated government full of corruption and hypocrites
That try to immoralize yourself when they untouchable by laws, that's bullshit
They say I'm overrated, but I'm highly educated
Incarcerated but reinstated and I know them faders really hate it
Rest in peace Malcom and King, TRU soldiers of the black folks
See while yall gone, I'm a be a mouthpiece for the ghetto
I feel like it's my duty, I be elected through spirit
One of the chosen few soldiers from the infamous No Limit
Records, a cooliation of highly respected ghetto millionares and servents
Just some independant brothers that deserve it
Now don't point your finger partner, just pratice what you preach
Cause it really ain't my fault playa, so don't blame me
Believe me
If I had my wish I'd robbin every day nigga wake
Cause if you let the world tell em my lyrics are the reason why
Lil niggas took the pains they can't take
Or the troubles he left behind
Why I gotta be the vision
I ain't even lookin at when your child choose music and he choose mine
But if you was a better parent he wouldn't look up to my kind
And time life taught me
The last minutes of your life is like bail, you either make it or you don't
You either goin love me or you won't
But don't blame me when your child ain't got enough to eat
And nigga I appreciate if you goin buy my CD's
But yall ain't got a decent pair of shoes on his feet
The streets taught me you gotta accept your blame and don't blame it on others
I look at my mother and I watch her suffer
But we beat the bad times in  uptown
And nobody gave a fuck, everybody came around
We made it on our own
And turned a fucked up life into a happy home
Don't blame me because my skin tone's like God's own
The oldest skeleton was chose to be an Africans born
I'm from a strong race of people who can never be denied
Every tear we cry's like rain water and so our sea dries
Ghetto flowers shades of ebony in full bloom
Women of color got sentenced, blessings unto our womb
They'd rather see us doomed, placin flowers on tombstones
But BeBe's kids multiply while yall tryin to plum to save your own
Label me wrong because I spit the raw real
Yall feel all my verses, even if I curse it's straight through em
Screw em, I takes my blame, you hypocrites make me sick
Tryin to sabotage my arches, thoughts stay on some scandelous shit
Get a grip on the way you truely live
Entertainment can't raise your little kids
Run your households
You got to mold thier minds and tell them what to look out for

36038,Mia X,Hoodlum Poetry,"I came to this country with my mama
Everybody called her the white girl
But you all knew I had a lil' somethin' somethin' on me
Cause my outer was slightly tanned
Southern folk called me a yellow gal
I've been out here in this world for a while now
Bringing madness and mayhem to man, woman, and child
You see my mother, the white girl had several lovers
So my father's true identity has yet to be discovered
Some call it A-1 soda others V-12
Doctor Tishner has been implicated
But all of their seeds are incriminating evidence
As far as my perception goes
My mother, she was indeed good, but I was most powerful
Just ask anybody in your hood
You can even ask those in corporate America about this mobstress
Most times, I as little as a pea, though my weight fluctuates
Size ain't shit, cause I have enough game to make you steal from ya mama
And call her out by her name
I can make her neglect her children, sale her body, perform dirty tricks
On her knees and be called the neighborhood hottie
Everybody's a thief and a liar once they make my acquaintance
They be anxious to buy my love, they lust for me
Want to hold me and test my purity, but it's only for a moment
You see the ecstasy that I give to you
It's only temporary but quite costly
I'm bossy from your very first encounter with me
I tell you, you need me, gots to have me, can't live without me
The pea, my game extends, it gets deeper
You see my skills don't pimp just the weak minded
The so-called big ballin' brothers are obsessed with me
They kill, rob, and plot on one another to possess me
They see me as a goddess
The financial path that will lead them out the ghetto
But don't they know, have a clue
That I and my mother were sent here to destroy them
To entice, baffle, and trap them
Conscious people call the conspiracy genocide
Well, what do you think
I mean you make money off me, while they pile up evidence on you
Then get you to spend all the money you're stackin'
On lawyers and bail bondsmen
They seize your property and worldly items
That have you caught up in this lifestyle
Material things that turn friends to foes
Woman to hoe, man to monster
Yeah nigga you've changed but so what
Cause I give you what you need I give you power
Make you feel invincible right by me
I make you feel like a big man, timer
No matter how fat, ugly, illiterate you are
I make the prettiest women love you
Fight over you and compete with others trying to give you babies
I make your relative, want to kiss your ass
Treat you like a king and roll out the red carpet
They've got one hand out for money
And the other hand has a pen in it so you can sign your life policy
My assistance makes you have that edge over the next man
Cause it's all about me and money, the root of all evil
The necessities of function in this society
I make all your gangsta dumbass stories interesting
Cause you are the man
I mean we listen in awe as you speak of your murder tales
Ménage a trios, homosexual advances, and secret romances
I'm bout it and I make you feel bout it bout it
I split family, split friends, split lovers and even business partners
So niggas nickname me crack, ain't that something
I'm the reason why a lot of people are homeless, crazy, crippled
Why they're HIV positive and dead
But you still want me, feel the need for me to be in your possession
Fear to get high off my intoxicating little pieces
Or to spread my love to profit
You're even willing to kill and die for me
And even though my mother, the white girl
Engaged in several orgies for my creation
I still know my father, you know him too
You follow his lead, and work with him
Claim you hate him but your actions are different from your tongue
Let's face it, you serve him faster than you do your God
We own you nigga
And as far as the ones that send I and my mother here to destroy you
We own them too
So after all my destruction, I must pat myself on the back, uh uh
I am crack, the devil's daughter
Human life, minds destroy ya
You need me, yeah ya do, for sho' ya do, you really do
So go head on nigga, take a hit
I'ma keep putting you out on the streets
Freeze you now, help me to kill you
Hoodlum poetry, food for ya mind
Wake up deaf, dumb and blind, it's time
I'm the masteress, I'm the mobstress
I'm the pimpstress, and I own you
I'm the masteress, I'm the mobstress
And I own you, I'm trying to kill you
And I'm succeeding, yes I'm succeeding
I'm trying to kill you and I'm gon' do it
I'm gon' kill you, I'm gon' kill you

36040,Mia X,Flip & Rip,"1 ContributorFlip & Rip Lyrics
Yo Mia.  I got the firest beat and I want you and Mac to bust off it
So who goin first?
It don't matter to me, Boo
Well, we gone flip for it.  Call it in the air
Heads
Tails
Mac, you up first
Say, KL.  Since I gotta go first and shit I'ma kick this shit one more time
For the old fake ass niggas who thought I lost it.  Ya heard me?  Check it
Street camo Cover my flesh
I'm one of the best in the contests
They steppin to Mac without a vest on they chest
If all you wanted was rest Then I'm your Nyquil guy
Your night time sniffin and stuffiness I kill with one shot
The murder murder verses Quench lunatic's thirsts
I get pussy from nurses Comin from churches
The camouflage A-S-S A-S-S I-N I'm deadlier with my pen
Then niggas with the mac 10 But that was back then
In 98 I'm strapped Cuz I'm on the map
Ain't afraid to bust a cap And I get paid for bustin raps
I like them ghetto girls Y'all can have them super models
Cuz gangsta bitches got bodies like Coke bottles
I get the game from my nigga V9 I get the beats off the 3-9
Them niggas can't see mine I'm lyrically a therapist
A fuckin terrorist Boom Boom! I never miss I'm on the next level
Well I'ma flip it like this
And I'ma rip it like that
And I'ma rip it like that
And I'ma flip it like this
When the smoke clears I'ma still be here nigga
Mic in my hand Rowdy doin the rip the rapper dance
I set the lines behind the fallen emcees that challenge me
You cross my path You gets flipped in my wrath
The aftermath left bitches quiet as fuck
Like when the neighbors saw the crim and the cops came up
I rips it up from the gut Like Jack the Shanka Man
Chasin hoes down with the knife in his hand
The better man's gone be Mama And you know this nigga
On the top or the bottom I'ma show this nigga
He's goin to sleep I'm too deep The lady alligator
Stick your seven inches in the swamp And I'ma fade ya
I made you motherfuckers recognize the south
For the gumbo flava comin out my mouth
About drama Bout paper Bout settin it off
Fuck the verbal fantasies My shit is real y'all
Pass me the mic And let me dig into they chests
Like AK bullets through they proof vests
In a shootin fest I murder emcees like media
Mac the street encyclopedia Who wanna test me?
Bless me with somethin knottin
Bitches who start pussy poppin
Rhyme I quote em Nines I told em Like wallets
I'm rock solid And I like it when they suck and swallow it
I'm hardcore Fuck that slangin and shit Cuz when I'm on the mic Niggas be bangin and shit
I love them buck wild crowds
Mama be center stage
Throwin lyrics at them niggas
Like hand grenades
You can' take the projects out of a bitch like me
Six figures make me throw bigger block parties
Still warm my bed with a thug nigga of course (fo sho)
Still in the mix with all them messy ass hoes
Still bust a freestyle with my camouflage son
Off top, then leave the studio with my gun cocked

Huh nigga what, what huh nigga what

It's about pistol whippins and kickins
Mama dishin' and blitzin' (Mama Mia)
Cause you hoes gon' listen
Taught to issue the pain
And distribute some cocaine
Can you fuck man, nah nah
I'm known for loosen' brains
Bitch you think that I'm playin'
Go to war by myself, grab that gat off the shelf
Gon' say goodbye to your health
Got heroin in the mail but bet my dollars don't fumble
Stackin' tall like Mutombo, cause a bitch moving bundles, rumble
It ain't no thang bitch I'm straight off the tank
Niggas second in motion, I'm a fool with that shank
No, I ain't 2 be trusted
When I sneak I'm straight bustin' ya mouth
And ya nose and your eyes gon' close, swole
My kid sister Sherry puttin' big holes, in ya
Po-po's trying to find the next nigga ya kin to
Red dot center, bullets enter ya playa haters
My lace tip split ya fuckin' decision maker
Think you can take the biggest mama, bring the drama, go on
But make it known, official it's on
I ain't to be played wit', so fuck around and see what ya get
Toasting fingers to clips, playa haters get split
I'm running, humping your shit now rock-a-bye you look tired
So don't fight it baby close your eyes
I ain't to be played wit', so fuck around and see what ya get
Toasting fingers to clips, playa haters get split

Niggas out that booty or mister Corey Jalooty
Shoot now, fuck the convo nigga ain't no stoppin'
When it's on we poppin', street sweeper straight knockin'
What, what cocaine and trains leavin' niggas in gutters
Bringing pain to loved ones, burning up motherfuckers
Plus if ya touch one of mine this is how it's gonna be
I'm choppin' down your whole family tree
Forget me not, it's too hot
Up in that south, bitch you know how dirty
Better act in a hurry or I'ma load it with thirty
Dirty, serve me nigga by the pounds and kilos
And watch the gumbo pot, we breed the fattest rocks
Bag em' after the chop, push em' out the back door
Have the prepiest hoes runnin' buku dough

36042,Mia X,I Don’t Know Why,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, hey yeah, ahh no
So much yeah, ooh
There's so much trouble in my life
Sometimes it gets so bad I just breakdown and cry
I got my rent to pay and it's overdue
Don't wanna sale my body just to make it through
You see I can't depend upon no man
To be responsible or even understand
It's just the way it is at this point and time
Sometimes it gets so scared unless it blows my mind
Me and my homegirls, we got a plan
Every night at seven we'll take things in our own hands
Now we can play around, let's make some ends
I got my hustle on cause money's my best friend
I wanna be stress free, rest easy at night
But there's so much drama goin' on in my life
These days, nights missed get you labeled naive
And commons get taking for stupidity
So I keep my guard up in this macho world
Cause everybody's running game on mama's little girl
We getting babies from shady, wanna-be playas
Who wanna lay us, stick ya, hit ya, forget ya while we stay up
Crying till our eyes are swollen
Single mothers got the weight of the world on they shoulders
Want em' to hold us and tell us it's gon' be alright
Even the hardest sister needs a good man in her life
I paid the price and my life is still in a damper
After times of dirty dancing, get the babies pampers
And don't talk about the welfare and how they knock us
Knowing that chunp change can't provide nothing proper
While the doctors give us new-age birth control
They make the swollen to skinny
Bleeding constantly or missing monthly, scrapping pennies
While my kid's daddy slinging those Z's
But ain't doing shit for neither one of these
Should I ease up, grab a case, and set it off like Jada
Break with the paper, get in a comfort zone from pullin' capers
Makes us wanna holler, scream, and shout and say
Oh father, why I got live this way
I don't know why I live this way (I don't know why I live this way)
I don't know why I live this way (Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah)
I don't know why I live this way (I don't know why I live this way)
I don't know why I live this way (Don't know why, I live this way)
All my sisters keep ya head up, we ain't giving up without a fight
There's been a struggle but pretty soon we gonna bubble
Though trouble be knocking on my door like every 24-7
Heaven knows that I like to keep the bills in check and
Letting my kids down on they birthday
Gnaws at my heart and tears me apart
Can't let it go like this
Racing through the malls at Christmas time, Babylon
Got my mind on trip, December 25th ain't gotta bit
To do with Christ or his birth
Greedy devils give us pagan, holler
And profit off us give praise for better days
Better be ahead of what I said
Third, I can see I can destroy the mental chains on our enslaved brains
Cocaine, be the aim, be the means of profit
But logically it tells me I'm going to jail and getting killed
Oh well, I gotta do what I gotta

Angels!  Ooh oh ooh angels
Precious little boy and girl growing up fast, in this foul world
Mama's trying to do all she can to get through the tough times
Press rewind and go back to early days
And I would do it all the same way
Keep my babies, yeah I struggled
But God ain't give me more than I could handle
Sent me two angels when my life was tangled in knots
And they're all I've got
My everything so pure and sweet
Two perfect little parts of me, the heart of me
Mommie, pulled some rabbits out some hats to pay the bills
And fix ya meals, cause you both gave me the will power
To tower over obstacles in our path
And when I'm sad, ya innocence makes me laugh
So glad to have a son and a daughter, so I strive harder
To keep it tight and bring comfort in your lives
And I try not to bash ya dads and bring you in the drama
Though you both know I've been the daddy and the mama
And I'ma keep doing all I can
To make a strong black woman and man, out my angels
Oh my angels, yeah
Mommie's angels, mommie's a-a-angels
Oh angels, mommie's angels
You're my angels, my angels, my angel child
Ooh, mommie's angels, angel, angel
You're my angel, ooh, mommie's a-a-angels, angel yeah ooh
I'm ya real model
Don't need to play no role and I don't hold, rap, or move the dramas
For the way my flowers blossom
I'ma put it down and keep it real for the both of you
Expose you to life, let you know wrong or right like
If y'all sell dope you might go to jail or get killed
If y'all use drugs y'all will destroy ya minds, lie, and steal
Lose ya self-respect, essence and ya pride
And mama won't succeed the birth of ya rise, so strive
If y'all sleep around unprotected
Expect to have a bunch of little children
All diseases that can't be cured and
If y'all quit school ya play the fool that's half steppin'
Intelligent black folks are our strongest weapon, get ya lessons
Vocal sessions on the regular, eye contact
I'm ready to take responsibility for the mine's act
So save that blame it on him, her, them for mine
I'll have to find the time to shape their little minds
They're my angels
I'ma carry y'all till y'all can carry yourselves on ya own
Hugs and kisses way after y'all grown
Help ya out when ya need but stress independence
Unconditional love, that's my life sentence, no repentence needed
This is how it's supposed to be
And I'ma keep my children close to me
Hope to be, the best mama that I can
Precious Lord please take me by my hands

I'm gone off indo-nesia
And surrounded in my large body, 4-30 skeezer
They trying to get me for my dollar bill, my crumb but I ain't going out
Hit the backstreets and put that dank in they mouth
But that nigga take some chase, nine in they face
Call my girl on the mobile phone, bring the yellow tape
And it's on cause we balling, and I'm doing this shit
For Richmond all the way back to New Orleans
Where them killers hang, I mean them gangstas slang
I got a two for three, four for five I'm counting bank
And Mia X bout to hook it up, real good
I'm Mr. Rogers, Sarah Lee, she's the neighborhood queen
And I'm doing this like g's do
And them niggas just mad cause we hit them with this voo-doo
Southern, mixed with this Cali style
And Master P don't give a fuck cause I could go about a hundred miles
When any nigga chase me, amaze me
Police mad cause a young nigga paid g
And No Limit keeps a nigga's pocket swoll like I'm on perole
Ain't got no love for y'all niggas that want to be the row
Throwing blows like Tyson
Right ones and left ones but ain't no nice ones
Cause I'm a nigga, coming high-er than Biggie
A nigga making bank so call me the young diggy-wiggy
I mean the Al Kapone, of this rap throne
And beat the row to any nigga that got it going on
And snatch your wallet out your pocket
Your arm out your socket, niggas hate me, cause I got it

Packing mad flavor, it's in my nature to be, boss
To rat-a-tat-a-tat with plastic toys I mean go, off
Bring hella-noise, behind that F-E-D-D-Y
It's do or die, a ghetto bitch gone survive and try to stay alive
In 95, to position herself for that mission
To increase her wealth, the decision failed
Years to lay it down, cause I'm coming
Running this street rap shit, ain't no fronting, I'm on a mission
(Chorus)
Well it's the B-I-G-E here to make you holler
The last letter's D and the D stands for dollar
Sometimes I'm feeling my life is at a standstill
But I feel, that I can grow 7 figgas nigga, that'll be a mill
So let me chill, and organize strategically
Cause I'm a grown man and don't need my mama feeding me
So it's time to leave the, nest
Tims are getting harder, lives a little shorter
See this llelo, got my hood captivated
Innovated my spot, and major was the plot
So uh, I gots to make a decision with precision
Should I ball, slang dope, or rap for a living
But either all I gots to get them divid-ends
Cause the with my down south family to make some ends
So in this rap game there is no competition
Fool you better recognize No Limit, we on a mission

Hell naw, it them bitches now bitch get off me, biggest Mama Mia
Lady Smith & Wesson nine milli heater, wreckin' em'
Always got insubordinate say no you ain't no friend of Mia
You cannot see this ghetto diva, get rich either
So she wants to be a, but she's neither
Get her there, her central plans have been deviated
Tell em' why, her ho styles have yet to be appreciated
She's been waiting to see the fire from a real ho
No doubt who brings the noise like them bitches in a jailhouse
From el jay, or even worse a setback on a cold day
Those who play I hate, let it be known that I regulate
Will steal ya fate after just one rhyme
And chick ya left a buck jump after second line it's my time
So I bust without hesitance, every word man is evidence
Niggas clear the way cause ya lyrically impotent
Soft and mama likes it hard no doubt
I ride with the tank takes shots for the south

Down south my niggas bout it and we bound to take it all from you
I'm from the streets of NY where the wind don't die
We even try to bake the cake or pie
????, bust on by for my niggas incarcerated
Where you gotta do life or get your life confiscated
I often made it through the cold stages
Where the government supply drugs and breed thugs in all ages
Caucasians givin core cases
P's chase us like horse races
Battin down on all faces
Everyday it's like the same old shit
I ain't goin bit, my motto's like make more hits
Terror Squad and the No Limit fam for life
Don Cartegena, Mama Mia
Yeah, that's right
What's your point nigga, what you tryin to say
We got the same types of thugs right around my way x4
Walkin through your backyard, knockin down your trash
You move too fast and I'm a blast your ass
Will a nigga do this or will a nigga do that
Just know that my four four packed, don't pull back
So roll back, regroup, thank me 'for you come up
Please put your gun up, fool you gettin done up
I'm one up on every motherfucker in the giddame
Act like you don't know my motherfuckin niddame
And things won't never be the same again
Ain't no slippin to the quicken, we hit this game again
What's your name again, I'm the capital S
You know the motherfuckin rest, I'm from the motherfuckin west
Side of the coast, east side of the beach
School of hard knocks, graduated straight from the streets
Shit, my hair got longer and my pockets got bigger
I got love for real nigga so what's up jigga
I'm from the itty bitty city at the bottom of the Mississippi river
Where niggas quick to kill ya if they don't feel ya
Still the southern hospitality is all good
Just don't be fuckin around in none of them small hoods
Mama Mia, the queen of the south
Who states somethin like the one in my mouth
Love the NO, represent it till the day that I die
But I'm makin merges from CA to NY
And the tight connections, Terror Squad and DPG
And TRU soldiers nigga, N-O-L-I-M-I-T
We all the same, we used to slangin when we gangin niggas
I slang the pound different but we all about the drama
Hit the enemies down
Send your whole block all covered in duct tape ??? down
Get the ransom out this motherfucker

I puts it down like them 7 days of the unfertilized egg
I put it down like a punk do pussy
I put it down the way a fat bitch eat chocolate chip cookies
I put it down like it's 300 pounds, SPOT ME
I put it down the way Mr. T did the first time he fought Rocky
I put it down like trap doors and slippery floors
Put it all the way down like privates to stripper's clothes
I put it down the way you put down that shitty baby
I come to get down, but I put down on sheets of paper
They scared of it, the way I flow and how I think
I puts it down like the round out the tank
UHH OHH told ya'll nigga
We puttin it down
That's it no more no less
But I got Mac, Kane & Abel up next
So Mac hit em with something
Tell em what they done got

Or like when your momma catch you suckin somethin
That you shouldn't suck clown (boy put that down)
I puts it down like a live round murder murder
Or like them vegetarians do to hamburger
I puts it down like when the cops say freeze
Motherfucker put that pistol down put your hands up
And drop to your knees
And when you see me lay it down
Don't nobody make a sound you know
I spray it down if I catch you on my ground
I'm that nigga with that pistol
That hits you when you flex
And go to jail do 1 day and get out
Cause I got connections and umm
I puts it down like the last don
Soldiers get your blast on
Whoaa
I put it down like a nigga got snuck in the chin
Put it down like when the SGT holler give me 10
Put it down like cement shoes when they drop in the river
Put it down like my rocks when the po pos chasin a nigga
I put it down like a casket goin down 6 feet
Or something like them dice when they bouncin off the street
Put it down like some shit when it hit the toilet
Put it down like some coke when I'm bout to boil it
Put it down like babies fallin out the bed
I put it down like the soldier rag saggin on Mac head
Put it down like Pippen on a fast break
Put it down like freaks hittin the ground
After beat down on Jerry Springer tape
Wait put it down like shells hittin the ground
When I'm bustin rounds
Put it down like beats by the motherfuckin pound
KL in the 1st round
AHHHHHHHH
Mama Drama and Fiend up next
Nigga What
I puts it down like pens and pad like Mama Drama rhymes
With the mind of nostradamus the bombest
Droppin on Pearl Harbor nigga yeah that's the way I lets it go
I puts it down like Reecee at the stone show
I puts it down like four flats on the deserted row
With no gun, phone, or triple eight to save you hoes
I puts it down like mommsha's lips on satan's dick
And you love it

I puts it down like Roy Jones' opponents
Lookin up at the referrees so haters you don't want none

I puts it down like billy clubs smashin heads during the riot
Excited cause I puts it down like that niggas hands
When his fingers got a chance to feel past my underpants
I puts it down like order in the court no doubt
And lays it down like the motherfuckin rules in mama's house
I come around hype put it down like how it sound like vicious
I put my name on my game style tight like a dyke does bitches
Watch me excite these bitches once they know who I be
Bustin out the expedition ????????
Did you see me on MTV blowin zone up in the zone
Put down my # on paper because I wanna put a down on
I done clown zones, I'm a bust rounds on see I'm a Jones
And I put it down like Cedric fame by louisiana up in the dome

Sistas recognize no matter how you try to understand
To understand them
Oh noo you can't trust a man
Look here, I'm goin out with tha homies
And dont you even give me no lip like you own me
You want me couked up so you can do yo thang
But now it's time boot up and say some thangs gone change
Like when yo pager rangs
Whats up wit all these codes
You turn tha thang upside down readin stuff from yo hoes
I suppose thats why I got on my clothes
Gon have a dance
A drink or 2
And I ain't even trippin on you
Cause tha things you think is slick really ain't
You think you bein a playa
But looka here
Dude you can't
Cause I work everyday, but I dont pay nan bill
Sex you only when I want
And never do fix a meal
But on tha real
I be that pimpstriss, mackadame with game
Got tha mind playin
Met tha trick indeed to bring tha pain
Cause yo lame excuses
And yo tore up lies
Left you hanging wide open
And i ain't even tryin to cope wit
Yo mental cause it makes no sense
Thats why nothins goin on between us but tha rent
I spent alot of time tryna figure you out
But now I finally understand
You just can't trust no man
You can't trust a man ( why they always cheatin)
You can't trust a man ( why they mess up tha way they do)
You can't trust a man ( why they always cheatin)
You can't trust a man (You can't trust a man)
As long as a trick comes fallin down
It gives me all motion to keep my suit fo tha clown
I'se be like get on down
Boy get on down
I'm hella known fo my strut through my town
Suga T here I be its me
Momma always told me dont nathin come free
They ain't shh
We knows how it goes
Always tryna come up on tha rolly hoes
But tha skys tha limit
I keeps my hmm sewed up
They backs up off tha hmm
Because I'm tryna make a buck
Chuggin tha lug cause i be down wit da funkin
Niggas be on my jock like a tree be on tha stump
Packin junk in my trunk
Must i buck em
Callin me all on tha top notch to bust some
Lyrical master in tha front
Be on this rap scene
Who do I be
Cause i be that tool with tha classy
Breakin em down
Shakin em up gettin em stuck
Supa bad and ain't givin a fuck
No love No lust
Cause thats tha way it goes
Cause they ain't shh
You tear me up on tha inside
I hope my hardhead understands
Cause I can't trust no man
Damn even though he's a trip
It's hard to let go cause I'm used to his tricks
I'm scared to find anotha deal with his habits
That might even turn out to be more drastic
I'm mackin and he's ackin on his p's and q's
But fo how long fo real until I get tha blues again
I miss makin dinner fo 2
Candelight, bubble bath and tha rendevous
But I do know i ain't lettin him have his cake
And his ice cream while he eats his steak
I mean I ain't down to share no I can't understand
Some otha chick up in tha mix wit my man

36049,Mia X,Ghetto Livin’,"ng (ghetto living)
Ghetto living (ghetto living)
My mama once told me (told me) that the streets ain't safe
So I walked 'round with a vest and a strap on my waist
I'm living in a strange place where all the odds are against me
I'm doin bad and the shit you got is startin to tempt me
We never had cause the ghetto got us trapped in depression
Learnin lesson after lesson cause the devil be testin
It got me stressin, keep my Smith N Wesson cocked at all times
Cause even I could fall to victim at the drop of a dime
But that's the chances I got to take to escape all of this madness
That put you in the casket for the cornbread and cabbage
Lord knows I'm tryin to find an exit out the ghetto
But it won't let go, that's why I got to tote my pistol
Ghetto living
(Father forgive me, I know that what I do is wrong)
Ghetto living
(I been tryin a find a better way for so long) x2
Soldiers die in my world but people look at killers like stars
We duckin from the laws cause we ain't tryin to live behind bars
Growin up with less, envious of what the next man had
Never knew what livin good was till I started movin them sacks
My hood infested with crack, that's why I paint a picture so vivid
I tell it cause I live it, runnin with boss bitches and niggas that get convicted
This street got us all, nothin changed in the game but the players
I'm talkin about the hustlers, the ballers, the killers and the rhyme sayers
That's why I ain't scared to pop a nigga, stop a nigga, drop a nigga
I only fuck with the real, cause it's real in my battlefield
I hope it's true what they say, and that the father forgives
Excuse me for the things I do cause in the ghetto I live
Chorus x2
This shit's goin get even realer, so you ain't gotta ask, I feel ya
I live the life of a hard knock, that ghetto bitch on the block
My nigga had a shop, I took the rocks and bag weed
Chased them broads down with china, and ran alot of minors
With big tymer dreams of money, hoes and clothes
They didn't get it, tombstones and jail cells also come with it
I pity all them babies born from crack mama's
But I'm a mama too and when the bills is due I gotta
Get it how I live, bitter tears I cry
My best friend, my cousin and my man died
Or should I say was murdered
I know you heard the same stories before
We walk the streets like we poverties whores behind the dollar bill
This still life got us dying so young
Precious Lord let the new day come
Uh, come on
Cause ain't no winning when your living like that
It's the blueprint, the plan, the set up, the trap

I've been trying to do my thing
Since you've been away
But I think about you everyday
It's still hard
I'm still bitter
Still missin you sister
I pour out a little liquor
Spray your favorite perfume
We hit the blunt now and then
Bust out laughin and chokin
Cuz me and you really wasn't bout no smokin
Your mom is coping, but it's so rough
I can see it in her eyes
I can't stand to be around her too long
She makes me wanna cry
Why do God sometimes take away the good ones
That's the big question that's got everybody stressin
Ask him for me, so I can tell the mothers and fathers
Who can't stop mourning for their sons and daughters
It gets hard around the holidays and your birthdays
We try to keep busy, taking extra work days
My hurt days is when I go to ???
Cuz I ain't got my girl to split it with
I really get sick
When I think about that dirty nigga
But mentally I know he's gettin his
That makes me sleep better
I'm never gonna let your memory die
Even though a big part of me died when you left us
I bought my moms a house
The kids are gettin so big
Even got me a man and all
We call him Hotboy
Our kinda nigga
Thugged out, slugged up
Bad temper known for tearin shit up
He treats me nice though
But I wanna let you know that I'ma work hard
To stay on the right track and stay on guard

And I'ma end this until we meet again

A lyrical ruckus has erupted
And fucked wit' yo' manhood
When I get up and start bustin
Niggas just be like *ugh*
Get out my way, from this day on I put a dent in this shit
I know a lot of bitches thought it, but mama's endin' this shit
Been in this shit
My aim is to disfigure yo' style
And put it to sleep because the industry don't need no freaks
Meanwhile, my clique is settin' up shop on yo' block
And KLC got every car, bumpin' these ignorant knocks
Fuck them cops, and the mics, bitch I know my shit's tight
Just show us pain from the street, is what them niggas like
No half-steppin', my hooptie is a legend, shall we talk numbers?
Pull my bankbook out, and watch these figures stun ya, run ya
Why you niggas be lyin' on records?
Hoes barrin' marked hoes from D.O's to I don't know, but check it
Why y'all fakin' tha funk?
I raise my right hand trust, everything you see wit' No Limit
Belongs to us, let's get straight
Let's get it straight, you gon' know her when you see her
That's mama, the biggest mama, mama Mia
(2 Times)
Now I'm unlady like, my verses hit yo' ears like Boo-Yah!!
I wear the pants in every freestyle stance with my verbal hoo-ride
Do I, ever slack up on that ass? Hell no
I threw the K well away, so it's so swell it stays so
What you know about me is just I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
And that our mob's T-R-U because they rowdy, rowdy, no doubt
Hey those beats, was meant for me like a cellmate
My brown lips fucked the piss out his 8-0-8
Drum kicks, and then they creep like TLC
And hella fast with O-Down, Mo B. Dick and Craig B
The beats, by the pound, nigga, best beware
Y'all ain't even comin' close to what they puttin' out there
My mama, got the drama, for any hoe, but mainly all
You Milli Vanilli hens who ain't got no pen better know
No Limit, I represent it, in a minute, to win it
With the gold and platinum finish
Let's get it straight
Late niggas be writin' all kinds of fucked up shit
About my family
P, Silkk, C, and my tank doggs, but we ain't even trippin
Punk critics, nah, you almost cryin', we'll buy up every
Publication and put you out a job, you still shy, everyday
Nigga think we can't?
Contemplate before you come to walk against a tank
I'm tellin' you one more gin', may have you where I want
But best keep hidin' behind them pen names cuz I know
You don't, wanna see us, because you wish, for a grant
You hit.  One mo' time hoe, and yo' ass gon' meet the
Fish, of the M-I-Crooked letter-Crooked letter-I
Humpback, humpback, I ain't lyin
We on a mission, wit' nothin' but ebonics comin' through
Yo' system, flippin' rocks for phonics, but it's crime
Because you listenin
And you bob yo' head, better than a hooker, but yo' jealousy
Got you hatin' sayin' I woulda', they shoulda', they coulda what?!
We got the plat-screen property ebbin' us, but most of all
We still black owned and independent, let's get it straight!
Let's get it straight, you gon' know her when you see her
That's mama, the biggest mama, Mama Mia
Get it straight, you gon' know her when you see her
That's mama, the baddest mama, Mama Mia
Get it straight, you gon' know her when you see her
That's mama, the biggest, baddest mama, Mama Mia

Bullets rain as we killers post it up and took aim
Sellin dope, low and high, didn't notice he came
We was all strapped slippin, didn't see he was there
By the time I realized, bullets was hittin the air
Just then my nigga whole neck got hit
Saw he dropped and I knew we was in some gangsta shit
He was professional, see my nigga kept on his vest
Word was the killer was paid to put him to rest
Bustin rounds, bustin back, tryin to empty the clip
Tryin to move fast to save him, I knew he was hit
Everybody at the scene who swore they was hard
Had a strap deemin to bust, or squeeze out a far
Ten figure niggas whippin gats and bezzles
Bavgate still ridin like a rebel
Bitches wasn't ready when the drama came
Or Bavgate down to die for the Mama mayn
I'm still heavy in the game, I'm the king of the Oak
It's still the same cause the rap game is like the dope game
I'm smokin a taylor, strapped down with my kaylor
I walked up and dumped on the haters, you suckas can't fade us
They mad cause we famous, money didn't change us
Ghost Town, 7th ward, we armed and dangerous
I'm thugged out with one in the chamber
If you disrespect No Limit I'm a bang ya
Now tell me
Nigga would you ride or run
Would you crack under pressure when that drama come
(Drama)
Tell me would you live or die
When them choppers start to split and that hot shit fly
(Drama) x2
Motherfuckers ain't never gotta ask if I ride or run
I'm Mia X, alias biggest mama two guns
I done everything under the sun, been through it
I'm TRU to it, fuck who it gotta be
When the drama's goin down and I'm slightly affiliated
Bitches gotta get eliminated off top
When pressure drops I remain a hard knock
Bitch from off the block where everybody got they shit cocked
I rock that icy shit and roll with cut throats
Ghetto wise guys, Billy Bav and Crooked Eyes
Got to be a sad song blastin shit
For that No Limit click mama smashin shit
When drama came she sat beside me so I said fuck it
Whispered murder murder in my ear so I jumped in the bucket
Drama had a street sweeper and choppers and split em
Then she passed me them things and said let's get em (uh oh, ohhh)
Is all you hear nigga before I click clackin
Drama passed me the A-R with the full metal jacket
Kick the door off the brackets, drama took me in
Niggas know when I'm comin they see my dogs, ???
Drama taught me how to kill a nigga with fear
Bitch niggas shouldn't be here (Uh oh, ohhh)

1 ContributorLike Dat LyricsSomebody better tell these dumb hoes somethin
Cuz when I roll thorugh I ain't gone say nothin
Ain't shit to talk about
Cuz I can do without the souljah hatin
Them hoes is jealous of my fame and the money that I'm making
Got they heads aching
So they acting like they got beef
Knowin damn well if htey see me they gone speak
I'm Mama I'm respected y'all know this
But shits gone really get hectic
If y'all don't stop slow this ??? down now
The issue ain't who I'm loving or fucking
The big issue's billboard cuz I'm on top of it
The issue is I got my kids up out the projects
And bought my moms a new house
Before my second album came out
Respect my mind
I took my grandparents out the hood
I'm seein to it that their golden years be all good
So bestill the fact that I ain't selfish or greedy
Ask my people am I there when they need me
Like dat
I'ma leave you hoes in the same place
No progess
Talkin bullshit while I elevate
And I'ma keep looking out for the real
But I don't give a FUCK how the rest of y'all feel
And I'ma keep on learning the game
And I encourage all the my souljahz to do the same
I come in peace and I try to pack fair
But if you want to I will take you there
Like dat
Now I don't owe a motherfucker a god damn thing
And I earned the right to be the biggest mama on the tank
I sacrified beaucoup Put in so much work
Kept it TRU cuz I'm TRU And represented my turf
Downtown seven ward hard head Ya heard
Around a gang of uptown niggas
Straight screamin the third
Been bout it Been rowdy Been throwin for mines
It was just me and Jill on the scandalous rides
No hip hop lines to make me sound hard
It ain't no act It's a fact When it's on I go off
But as God as my witness I love being nice
Until this playa setting in my household was right
I like to just be me While you be with your knot
I'm trying to stay on top with TRU niggas fo sho
And we extend our hands to pull up more

Ass going all nonsense, common sense bitch
Mama striaght from the streets but I chose to retreat
Wha, and elivate my mind, right rhyming, spit game
Let the cocaine rise cause I don't need 'em migrains
Shake names, straight niggas or the sticky situations
New crowds, I play dumb but still I spray 'em
Mysterious Mia X, infamous dangerous
No Limit gorillas bust, foolish that ain't us
My ways, they stay the same
Either I love you or hate you, I diss you or date you
I make you or break you, play you when you play me, an eye for an eye
Treat muthafuckers the same way that I wanna be treated
I'm open, eat it up, lick it
But the condom on and hit it when I'm hot
When I'm not get the fuck from around me yo
Cause do it on my main concern is dough
Tell 'em clowns yo

In other words I don't need no nigga
Figures is high six, and gangin' like my lynch
Degreeded compliant licks with haters gon' die quick
The figures with fly bitch is me at the dinesh
Your hieness, queen of the South, droppin' bomb shit
You dime bitches don't wanna go there
You knuckle heads ain't a fueded hair on my black panther
I step tagged, got it ready for you totes
Represent the true bitches gettin' theirs and mo
Show a nigga it's good for conversation it would
Now throw a nut, take the leash off and what
That's how you do it ya'll
Times is hard and life's a bitch so we can't entertain the foolishness
Be bout your work
Floss the jewels, push the six, sip the cris, but buy the house first

Come on now, get a groove going

Hey you, blow your whistle *Whistle sound*
Yo, yo, yo, Tony, what up? Heard your dick was good
You should know, yo, I fucked you on the side of my hood
Never that dog, from where you can never hit it
Throw a razor in my mouth on the low and suck your dick with it
The world famous, priceless, steel stainless dick
Pray over this sculpture of love, nameless
Heavyweight dick in your jaw
Good lickin’ from your lips, now baby girl, throw the saw
Ayo, Tony, you phony, we both signed to Sony
But for half your pub, ride that dick like a pony, what

Girls, all eyes on my dick
Yo, yo, yo, cats fatigued out, thinkin’ they armies
My crew arms me with beats, how we swarm bee?
Who bang? B’More and Wu-Tang, new thang
Mad at how we do thangs, RZA copped me two fangs
Official, now I bite through gristle
Gold teeth style learn from Philly to Staten Island
While in the meantime, spit mean lines
Fuck clean rhymes, like mine's grimy, like my niggas be
Picture me coming off soft, y'all just cough up shit
I swallow rhymes, makin’ bitches swallow nines
Redefine this rap shit, make my shit a classic
Like Beethoven, stay posin’ for the camera
Stamina like a crackhead and crackheads are amateurs
You try me, no in-between like Y to Z
Pick brains like lobotomies still thoughts to charts of Billboards
Throw pour ill spores, leave niggas stiff like stillborns
I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up
What, what, what
I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight
Stand up baby, stand up baby

And now I wanna tell ya how to get your thing together
I’m like Spider-Man, fifth brother up in the Clan
Drop like crack that’s scattered all up in your van
Skelly-man crook, character star in Donald Goines book
MGM, Heaven & Hell, sat with the cook
With the big spice bone, red hairs is killin’ it
Knotted up, twisted and green, see them crystals in it?
Rap Yogi Berra
Bear hug a 500 ounce of that Staision, wild man, Sarah
Rush after hours, Alfred in the Batcave
Hands like Dai Smith, rap Hagler with a fade
Magilla, Charli Baltimore witch-hazel drip from your drawers
When faced off with the Killah
Stood still, a whole river chill
Looked up, it got dark, that’s when RZA started to build

Hey yeah, I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up
Hey you, blow your whistle *Whistle sound*

Shots crazily, steady blazin’ where the spades be
Teams like Starsky & Hutch, super deluxe truck
Ya bankrupt, 52’s Knox, I heard you Ku Klux, damn
Tear it out the van, sweat it with a tan
Wicked like Remo spray can, Sugar Duran
Fuck a cocktail, get my balls licked in Hell
Read his Igloo Tales, hell all the dogs with broken tails
Salt range, Salt-Water taff, Ironman bubble bath
Nucleus, split the atom in half
Meet damoes, fifth brother bug inside 8 pole
Change though, crush the birds inside shrimp rolls (yo, yo, yo)
Rap conspiracy, hold songs for ransom
Lancin’ in Ghostmode, coke mixed with Branson
Sheisty, tree's soaked in half-ki’s
Sabotage N.Y. with snipe’s and 79’s
Channel 9 scene, street team made news

Sickening, peep the scription, rhyme vixen
Keep the clips in tact, watch your back

Ya'll already know that Charli's in charge
Weekly massage, platinum and gold cars
Money stashed in NY to Witchita
And I stay with my niggas cause you know how bitches are
Aggy, cause they baby daddy wanna bag me
That's why I never leave home without the chrome maggy
Ya'll hoes can't do nothin' to me
I got this game wrapped like a dubee
Pinned up in what?
Charli rappin' about, I really got
And it ain't that I'm stuck on myself, I'm really hot
Chorus
For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh)
For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (really need it, yeah)
Verse Two: Charli Baltimore
Yo yo yo, feminin honey
Rich bitch be swimmin' in money
I need Jet Ski's in mind, can't tease a dime
Lookin' in the mirror, feeling pleased with the shine
Lady Rolex for the time, the class is ""S""
Wear the ice on the bra on my chest
When the money ain't right I go far to the left
Niggas wanna play games then Charli direct
Wanna Long Kiss Goodnight, don't hold ya breath
Niggas know I'm the shit with my MAC lipstick
Crushin' the player haters with a purple navigator
Shoes alligator, my bag is too
If I was broke like you, I'd be mad like you
But you can come work for Charli, a boss with a body
Ask anybody, I could take over Gotti
Poo by the poo while you just another hottie
Pissy broke bitch that'll stay if it's notty
Chorus
For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh)
For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (really need it, yeah)
Verse Three: Charli Baltimore
Uh huh, yo when you look you see the slim waist leavin' no trace
Cause shit for no Charli will be in the breifcase
Yeah Long Kiss Goodnight, Baltimore get it right
For the cash, hop out the window and shoot through the ice
Ain't no love here, just the black gloves here
Check it, and I don't get by with nothin' I can't leave in 30 seconds
But my kids, they think mommy a teacher
They don't know, for the love of this
I make the whole world tre` dough
Bingo, get 'em ready for school like nothing happen
Here's a apple for the teacher, tell 'em mommy said ""Hi""
Bet he won't fail you no more, one more ""F"" and he die
Even with my nails done, I can take guns apart son
So when they come lookin' for this reporter broke Un
Dealt with birds, but I had to move on
But for memories I tattooed a little peacock on my arm
Ask Un how the ones be when he advance me dough
So I put out mines and tell dawg keep yours yo
For real...
Chorus

Yo, all my rhymes - I rip it; the song had to clip it
The cats in the street, nearly killing over snippets
Birds gotta feed 'em bread, so he can eat her head
I'm almost 21, but I still pee in the bed
Had to flead the FED's, all be trife
And I got a crush on Edith (who, Archie's wife!)
Yo not monagomy, pornograhy
On the outside, like an apostrophe
Tell my girls, I really like photography
Snap shots naked, the wildest boss
First night, head whop, and our salads tossed
While you in a mean Neon, I'm with Celine Dion
Throw her in the bed, she the next one I pee on
Say what bitch
Phase two
Yeah yeah

What what what
Split that ass yo
Split that ass
Yeah uh, what

Yo, N-O-R-E; fuck y'all, niggas get hurt
You know I rock a Soul Train wit' a Cam'Ron's shirt
Doin' cartwheels, all my niggas got Hot Wheels
You a double A-R god, the bluntiest
You know we throw away, blunts for my niggas that's dead
Pour a Law Liqour, drink a long ligga
Then again I never beat, for my nigga Digga
You know I got, navigators, so we won't get lost
N-O-R-E, these Queens niggas call me the Force
At the arraignment, Thugged Out
Undertainment, for the lawyer - fuck 'em and the judge saves it
And I - did every crime - nigga name it
Fools ain't ever know, the ghetto's be the baddest click
Charli's Angels, tangle with Devil's - Advocate
Hoes mad cause our pussy's got the fattest clits
It's some status shit, how we gon' have a bitch
Under pressure, the Un undress her
That's a tester, that's just the best flirt, to the best skirt
Ever make it to networks

Anything we put our hands on, soak up like a tampon, plan on

After I get her credit, yo we goin' to the mall with it
Yeah nigga, you know the lie, fuck that bitch
The only reason I don't kiss her, is cause she sucked his dick
And I don't even trust, ourself bro, fuck dat ho
Pussy stinkin' anyway, let her go
Yo ya'll niggas stay fuckin' with them grimmy chicks
On the real though, I wonder where ya'll find these chicks
West Haven it , I'm the type to split on niggas
But if they right, I'll fuck around and spit on niggas
And if they into that hot shit, I might let 'em hit my spot quick
But first they gotta pop shit
If not then they gettin' drop kicked

She works hard for the money
So hard for it honey

Verse One: Charli Baltimore
Whatever you gotta, do for the Prada
On sex, each minute, ten dollars
24 hours, on Beauty Parlors
Poppin' that tower, moves be power
Why ya'll sour, I deals in bragoits
See my thugs just ahppy with Nautica sweats
While I look vexed, these cats get over
Peace to the Rover, who sleep on the sofa
You nine to five, I'm five to nine
Sign dotted line, checks all mine
If ya'll haters wanna courtsy me fine
But I met mills, ya'll ain't worth a dime
Ain't worth my time, curves stay dented
Gotta do a bid, daddy watch the kids
Whatever I did, to get this cash
Did it hard, so spell me out real fast

From the intro, nigga had me hooked like indoe
Shoulda kept my shit tight like homes with no windows
But women knows
Ballers, be sayin' that right shit
On some layin' that pipe-shit
But me, got right quick
Open, still kept my feelings tight-lipped
Trippin', all game was slippin'
Off the hyped bit, always been the tight bitch
Keep these cats in line, pay that rent on time
And we'll talk about extra keys to my spot
When it's extra V's in my lot, extra G's in my knots
So how I managed to get damaged on 'chill with one nigga' shit
I was to break me off with some more figures bitch
I don't know, just caught me at the right moment
Vulnerable, nigga jumped up on it
With mind games, took me out of my frame
I ain't even want his payback, my homey Tony Drapper
He pimped for the guts and I was givin' 'em up
Can't tell me I can't have any player I want
And I burnt myself out tryin' to turn his ass out
All he wanted was a fling and no strings
Slayin' me, on some less weighin' fee
One-half of his shit
But when it blew up, I said fuck this rappin' shit
Been sheisty all my life, and it came back
It happens when your minds attached to your perfect match

He was trippin' off the way I was OP off the trick
He said, ""Yo, you can scoop any nigga you wish""
Just seperate the dick from your mind and shit
Make that punk recognize how your time was spent
How your time was lent, not how your mind was bent
Get yourself back from that cat
And rise above, only way to pimp
Is to pimp the one you love
Wise words, my dog got me trained right
Game tight, had to stay strong and to stay tight
Stay nights, with my doggie
Knew he had my back till the day I made eye contact
With my old boo, best friends, remember what I told you
Pimpin' ain't easy, gotta play sleazy
Went to his house, put it on him and bounced
Fucked him with my eyes open, got him groppin'
Tables turned, nigga stressed, nigga guessed
He could play a player
But I got schooled and fooled him
Ladies let me tell you how you get it and win
First shit on him and then say forget it on him, yeah

Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
(More and more)
Step from the darkness, with lyrical hardness
I'm a heartless
Ready or not regardless, I'm gon' start this
Part this, straight down the middle like the rod of Moses
Suckers think they cold as ice, I leave them in the freezer frozen
Me the chosen, me the golden
My controller, bigger and bolder
Knockin' them chips straight off his shoulders
It's over, no need to look back
You got beef
Give me the grease and raid and cook that
Look cat, don't provoke me
Lyrically I smoke thee like Annie Oakley
You think you the shit, that's a lie like Pinocchi-o
You didn't know that I assassinate 'em
Wipe 'em off the map, and baby then eradicate them
'Cause I, I be the master, think it's disastrous
When I crash MC's like the Indianapolis
5000, I'm housin', check one-two on this, I'm hot
Rage in effect I wreck you on this, I'm out
Scarlett fever, cunt diva
Slick bitch quick to leave you
Deceive you, then cop a one way ticket to Indonesia
I sees you but you ain't no threat to a bitch like me
You can ice me, or step on my toes ever so slightly
And I'ma scorch your punk ass in the nine-ocho
We live immortal
Ice the cake out, you can't get a morsel
You light in the ass bitch too frail, I'm bout to set sail
Fuck waiting to exhale, find me on the block for the next sale
Why you swearing you rhyme hot?
Bitch I got it locked like Comstock
You bout to get rocked, so put the bunny back in the pots
As for the Glocks, they plastic
What color? Pick your casket
I know it get drastic
But bitches like you gotta get blasted

Trouble in my way, I gotta cry sometimes
Get high sometimes, and pray to my God, I don't die sometimes
But in the event of it happen, remember me for my rapping
And slashing a niggas ass for the fuck of it 'cause I'm Brat
I'm roastin' bitches daily baby, it's the oven in me
What you be jealous fuckin' hoe, you always looking at me
Act like you know, Gangsta Boo never buyin' you baby
In the Mercedes and 380s, Charli pass as to Lady
So I can spray these bitches up, tryin' touch my position

Try to feel me, yeah
Time flies
Still remember all the good times spent
Trips to the beach, watchin' horror flicks
And even though you and mom wasn't with each other
You all showed each other love like sister and brother
When I was small everyday you picked me up from school
Called you by your first name, you were so cool
You used to tell me everything I know from youth till I grown
So why you waiting to tell me how the problems grown
And you died on your birthday
It was my worst day
Call you dad know wish I did it from my first day
Just like my dog 18 with mad cream
Locked out on the drug scene
Had cats from other teams
Hatin', went from juvy hall to willy
In 6 months time Makaveli and Philli
But its hell when everybody's jailed
Gun shots to your back on Valentines Day
I miss you bell, damn
Didn't we almost have it all?
But love was all we had worth giving
The rise with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you made life worth living
Seventeen when I met you
I never bet you would help me bring a life to the world
And bless it yo
I thought we were destined to have our names tattooed
But I guess your depression got the best of you
Stressing you, things gon' work out
Cause we still friends but you choose to murk
When you had many reasons to stay
Suicide ain't the only way, it's the lonely way
Now everybody just left me with death to except
But I still had you, still had my boo
And we was right there at the height of everything
The height of your career I still wear my ring
And you said you wouldn't leave me like everyone else
One bullet took you instead now I dread
Thinking back to the last day I saw you
Picking up the phone to call you
Damn we had it all too
Didn't we almost have it all?
The nights we had until the morning
You know you'll never love like that again
Didn't we almost have it all?
Everybody can relate to loss
Even just a pet, you never forget
Death is the final say but you find a way
And survive keep your memories alive
Yo everybody can relate to loss
Even just a pet, you never forget
Death is the final say but you find a way
And survive keep your memories alive
Sing it with me

Yea
This for y'all
Uh uh
So many of us, envy us
Enough to just make a fly bitch bust with disgust
No homo, sick of how they pick me playin this chick
And clam I copped my phat shit from playin a trick
And my outside appearance gotta stay straight
The first opportunity to seal my fate
Even well off they say I feel off
If they catch me rockless
Automatically assume I'm stopless
Bounty's on my head for info
Gossipers turn philosophers lie
My whole life is so strife
So I write to escape my memories
I got a sudden right to escape my enemies
Without rap I'd probably be a talk show guest
Topics on my boyfriends and choppin less
I guess my life interreges for haters when it's fucked up
Copped a Navigator then what? Guess I suck nuts
My luck up, I'm stuck up
When I'm down they feedin off a bitch
Parasitin, so I'm writin this song for them
Light skin Type Slim
Think I had shit easy?
So you wanna talk greasy?
Please be judgmental after the facts
Yall pouters get to live my life on this track
This goes out to all y'all jealous niggas and bitches
FUCK Y'ALL!

Only love those who love you too
Only trust those who trust you too
Only hate those who hate you too
And never ever ever be a fool
And never ever ever be a fool
And never ever ever be a fool
At 15 received ass kickins from niggas
At 18 cats was ass stickin my niggas
I figure I never had a chance for peace
22 mom of two so the stress increased
At 24 four people I love diseased
In less then a year my life sweet from were?
Fear my tears
Cause they'll say its a break down
I take down the pain with Hennesy
But enemies shoot it up they veins high
Make lives tumors in other brains
I remain Tiffany Lane
No doubt tryna sort out
Fake friends fake men's
Stressed to fuck
They curious bout Notorious?
""Glorious Day"" like Springstein
When I bring dreams alive
Hatin can survive success
It turns to envy
And men be worse then bitches
Mad when I surpass their riches
But I hustle like niggas do
Cold nights to own Nikes and Polo
But to own rights and hold mic's for Dolo
I know hoes who suck dicks.and niggas alike
Just to say that they got me high
But despite all y'all and for y'all cause I ball y'all
I never fall y'all I still fight all y'all

Check it out.. I'm on water like the navy, baby
Everything is gravy, da ladies, dusted off the AB
Cam got a ill swore, how the fuck they put a thug up a billboard?
My spot you kill for, but I kill myself before I let you take it
Cause I buy another pie and it's so great to bake it
And when I flip that you won't see me, no more
Less it's on TV with CB and no 4
Straight bone crushers, the diamonds to custards
Did it all baby, R. Kelly down to Usher!
A Cam is a hustler, I know you think a top meal
Fuck all these records, I'm worrying about Glock sales
I put the ham in hocks, lamb in chops
You are all what Cam is not - mm! - god damn I'm hot!

No sweet niggas nothing but thugs

C.B. can get to your head, if you let me
Or give ya hed, if you let me
When you met me, never bet we'd be
Bumpin' and grindin'
Wore short skirts and drop shit when you was behind me
Design ways to fuck with no craze
Cause I know you've known my man's since 3rd grade, I stayed
Pure through his whores and tore's, overseas
You and me, too long
Look opposite you ball
Lil' sis', so you say
Wanna fuck me Tony?, Scarface-way with Gina, I mean the...
Signs be there, time we share, be sweet
Fuck that reckless till we shred the sheets
To confetti, ready, picture teddy and gaurders

Rub tit's, part lips, and watch you, I got you
Will powers down, got the ship mapped out
Cause that nigga's leaving town

Dreamin' bout you, wanna wake up
Suckin' on my ""A"" cups, make up
Reasons to see you
I can tell you want it, all you gotta do is
Push up on that
Ask ya nigga, you loyal?, drunk off Crown Royale
Tellin' me how he be gettin' down out of town
What he don't know, won't hurt him
One squirt through my tight skirt, then we can fuck all the flirtin'
All I gotta figure is, how to pull this nigga
Fool my nigga, but he dumb anyway
And his chime, anyday now, have me in the hay now
Dirty ass way down, I'm still gon' lay down
He on his way now, to keep me company
Little did he know, when he show
He'll be bumpin' me, humpin' me
Wantin' me to open my mouth
Let him spit in it, take the wetness, suck his dick wit' it

Five minutes or less, two seconds, I'm undressed
Open the door, threw him to the floor
Wanna whore like Del Rio, tell me no, take that, know my steelo
Dick's hard, feel tights like a vice grip
Or nice lips, both sex, I'm a veteran
You better win, I'm on top, don't stop

Serenade the street with heat waves
P.A. to B.K. bitches
Keep my cliques to small masses
Flossin' while ballers sweatin' our fat asses
Pass the G stacks, estates from ReMax
Fuck duplex and condos decline those
The kinda hoes need anchors to rape us
Mean suck a dick straight out yo ass
Man we chase 'em
Type chick to freak out, speak out
Hold the tongue when you getting sprung
Throw cheeks out
Went from had 'em to madam
You see a B-More bitch show you how to bag 'em
What? 9-9 roll through with a whole crew of divas
Philly style we pushin' up on playas like cleavage
Charli's chicks, big lips, big hips
Ride around big whips, cats with big dicks
Those videos or flicks, on the low we keep it
Like your dough we keep, if you slow we peep it
My Angel's Dust dangerous
For the average stash karats
Next Tyson fight, Prada bag ain't fake ours
Stick cats from the Lakers
Take trips to Jamaica, extra paper
Cats caught the vapors
Like Biz and Kane 'cause we done flipped the game
Like niggas flip they 'caine
From right to left lane
Fast crack, pass that
Play these rap cats for they ASCAP
Fuck that
In '91 take a hustle to King of Prussia Mall
Getting fly offa DKNY
All his dough spent, step to an event
Hot to death, I'm running out of breath, damn
Yo Un you want 16 more?
(Yo bitch just keep rappin')
Yo, my comeback never done whack
Cats stressed and nail me like a thumbtack
And bend these walls
Swallow wood daddy, keep the throat clear like Halls
Mentho-Lyptus gotta lick it backwards to hit this
They know I can rip shit, what?
Know I can flip shit, what?
Thought I was coming on some high yellow chick shit
Spit like a nigga and fooled ya'll
48 straight through ya'll
Bring a hot bitch to ya'll
I'm here for my boostin' bitches
Here for my FedEx the clothes back to Houston bitches
Here for my credit card scam bitches
In stores with they backs to the cam bitches
I'm here for my trick nigga bitches
Get paper stash that from dick quick bitches, what

Organs missin' or organs playin'
At your wake, however you wanna take it

Couldn't take the acoustics of dem big guns boomin' right through your G-Unit (listen)

Niggas might rob me
See these niggas that go with car figures
Papers dial mine, clothes custom figure
Matchin' Jon Gotti to roll through customs nigga
Roll the custom built shit, I bust them clips
Niggas trust my lips, while they suck they dicks
Plus the Kiss be the Long Goodnight
Murderous bitch be the wrong in spiked-typed
Price right, be that song, the right type
But only if Havoc and P spittin' wit' me
And they say they gon' see that C.B. nice wit' it
Hinnesy and Rimmy, and give me some ice wit' it
Shake down, niggas'll throw some dice in it
Put your Money on Chuck or in 9-9, you're fucked
Try your luck, stress this red-head
I mix blood in my dye, like my faily ties
When you in the mix with this shit
Skin and bones, nothing but the fists
Do your hard beat, rapper lay a bid
Other dogs posted up over here
Niggas fuckin' up, where my niggas at huh?
Niggas be frontin', where my niggas at what?
Yo they don't want it
This is live nigga rap
Scared getta gat but if not, it's cool
Cause right here is where it's at
Yo, when I foul out on lab mouse
One nut and I'm out
Ain't tryin' to stick around, let a nigga catch me out of bound
Don't give a fuck about a rumor
Know how I get down
Let my man's do it, he gots to right to it
Known Jay come through the door, still like they ""Who this?""
Don't got beef, but got niggas, serious ones
Make sure a nigga here, plus lasted wars
And stay countin' all that cash when I'm fuckin' wit' 'Un'
Fuck around with my funds, got a bring a gun
Please don't make me have to puncture ya lungs
Cause we the ones rockin' 'em, the ones toppin' 'em
Gold bars unpredictable, like Mystikal and Shock and 'em
We heavenly like BIG, Pac and them
Mobb Deep and Charli Baltimore, who's coppin' 'em
Who's lockin' 'em, who's hotter then them
It's like a dice game and Crack Tito totterin' them
Yo, all and together we gon' rush the front door
Get at them
They dumpin' our songs, so now it's on
Infamous, my niggas pop clips to this
And fight to it
Niggas respect it, it's like we magnetic
It's like the last thing you want is drama
Go at the girls, have a good time, don't make it a problem
While we pop bottles of Mo'
Burn down bottles of 'dro
Smack that ass of models and ho's

Tell your mom dog ain't shit gon change
The world don't trust us, one whore gutters
POV City hustlas, Ya gun motherfuckers
Hit the gun away bumps man I got these niggas
Tell Caddillac to chill I'm about to rock these niggas

Now I'm back on top, can't stop me niggas
It's hard like life, man dog I'm holdin the dice

When you see me on the streets pray for your life

I back down your whole strip, Let off six
Get low re-load quick Stand up and fire again

When I spit outta my mouth, niggas know what I'm about
It's no lookin back, tryin to get out of time to stack
Workin and puttin it in and waitin to get it back
Bloods thick and when money comes that's real phat

Fuckin wit niggas that's clown, fuckin wit niggas that's wild

I think we had something true and it's all lies

Huh
And the plot thickens
See I'm a little too far in
Starring
Me and you the main attraction from the preview
I should've stopped then
I should've stopped when it was textin'
Just lovers with no name
But then I locked you in
Pic saved, face flashing on my screen
So naive, in a way I'm exactly what drama means
(Drama means)
Stop the folks from rocking
I see sickness
And this game you're playing blocking all the roads to fix this
Nice lawn, just laying
4 a.m. telling me you're gonna stay in
But shе got nothing I ain't giving you
I keep saying ""fuck you""
But then you fuck me
I wind up fucking forgiving you
I'm through
Not another night
No morе pretending
No more cliffhangers
I need a happy ending
I need a part two
I played my part too
We food a flesh so in love before I thought it through
Good bitch, cruel intentions
Ready to call her, email her pop and mentions
So gone for you, I been watching her tweets
She at and your kissy faces while I'm watching our sheets
Damn you just left for promises and breaking it off
Lies I believe so clothes, I'm taking 'em off
I know the truth hurts, deception flies through me
And so I know it's real, just lies

Just say you ain't fucking bitches

Got a feeling in my gut, I already know it
Trying to ignore it but he feeling's getting worse
Cause you're moving kind of funny, now you got me on alert
Uh!
Claiming that this love, and this a happy home
But you went into the bathroom just to use the phone
Hoping that I'm wrong, knowing that I'm right
Cause all the signs sayin' you're fucking with a nigga, right? (right)
Like you ain't seen me calling you the other night
Like I ain't noticed lately you've been missing half the night
(Aw man)
You're playing with me bitch, you won't drive me mad
I ain't playing with you bitch, who brought this pain
It's the feeling in my soul that I can't avoid
Sayin' you cheatin' on me
You say I'm paranoid
You sent me what they do
I don't wanna fuck with you
(Nah)
Then I fuck you, than I end up being stuck with you
(Oh)
Tell me that you love me look me in the eye
(Look)
Playing that is true but you know it's probably lies
(Damn)
My homies keep on saying I should leave low
But I'm looking for a spot that I can live low
Caught in my emotions how it come to this

Got me searching through your stuff like I'm the bitch

Just preparing y'all
For the dynasty
Amil-lion, uh
Jay, Beans, Memph Bleek
Check it out, yo
Ayo, this time it's for my family, we ride or die
It's in the blood 'til the death, now aim for the sky
My four blow fo' sure, for dough, for only
It's money, drugs, and hot slugs
You know Bleek, squeeze hammers 'til they nail me
Fuck could niggas tell me
Street scholar, keep firin' is what they tell me
Drug chemist, thug nigga be named Memphis
Straight from the borough of them B.K. niggas
Where we rob for the fun of it, hustle for the drug of it
Wrap money in rubber bands, just for the love of it
Straight from my ghetto, we listen to heavy metal like
Desert Eagles, street sweepers, loud metal
It's hit and run now, motherfuck anyone of you
We them niggas be in your crib just like furniture
Pop up with the gun on ya
Release one for zero-zero M
Bleek-R-O-C dot com
Yeah, this Philly cat back at it
Still throwin' crack at it
Still fuckin' with them crack addicts
Still bust 'em with them black 'matics
It ain't the bucks, it's the rush
You tryin' to get my ass at it
They say I think ass-backwards
Fuck how I act, as long as I stack, it's all mathematics
Our tracks nice, hug the block to track dice
Late night, club night, Mack attract dykes (Woo)
I pull up, Cadillac truck nice
Two guns, you know Mack pack gat twice
Gets that crack back with that ice
No joke with the coke, I whips that right
No doubt, never a drought, gets that price (Uh)
It gets that nice when you live that life
Papi knows your name and you ditched that wife, nigga
Gets that green, nigga, gets that chain, nigga
I get forty G's a feature now
Hold Franklins like a Aretha now
In the SL two-seater now
And I'm in nothin' but diamonds
I'm the illest female that you heard thus far
5'5 with the 34B cup bra
I don't fuck with them cats who ain't up to par
I get niggas for cash, clothes, jewelries, plus cars
I'm talkin' rent money, I'm talkin' bank money
I'm talkin' Martha Keats step off with the rent money
Movin' on up, two in the sauna
Still ride through the block, pull up on the corner
Plus, give me an inch so I can take a mile
I bring life like a newborn naked child
Bitches tryna come up, gotta wait a while
As of now, Amil-lion just faded your style, nigga
Uh-huh, yeah, you dealin' with the, the Roc, the-the, the Roc
(Let me talk to y'all niggas real quick, man)
The, the Roc, uh-uh, the Roc
Yo, y'all niggas truly ain't ready for this Dynasty thing
Y'all thinkin' Blake Carrington, I'm thinkin' more like Ming
I got four nephews, and they all writin'
They all young and wild, plus they all like things
And I'm havin' a child, which is more frightenin'
What y'all about to witness is big business, kid
Big bosses, cocky, and big Benzsesses
Come through flossin' 'em, shiny rims of theirs
And losses don't pop up in their sentences
I don't think you understand what type of event this is
I don't think you know how focused young Memphis is
Or how Sigel's so real, when you add on Amil
This is much more than rap, it's Black entrepreneurs
Clothing, movie, and films, we come to conquer it all
Rocawear, eighty mil' like, eighteen months
You can bullshit with rap if you want, muh'fuckers
When it's all said and done, we gon' see what's what
Holla at Hov', I'll be in the cut (What, huh)

Owe like they stole
On somethin' on fame, I got that from Hov
Plus, I got my own bread
You ain't gotta wave dinner over my head
I got that
And you can't leave me stranded
'Cause I got a ride back, and besides that
What chick you know got cock, Glocks back?
Eight in the back, they rockin' hot jacks
In high heels, mini-skirts and thighs fat
My style's like the international
Pancake house or whatever avenue
I got that, I got that
Think I need you 'cause the rent is due?
You can be outta here, baby (Baby)
'Cause I got it (Hey)
I got it, I got it
'Cause cash, coupes, credit cards
All the exotic things, baby (Oh-oh)
I got it (I got it)
I got it, I got it
Ever since cats found out I ran with the Roc
They wanna take a closer look, wanna examine the box
Magazines want cameras to pop
They wanna catch me in the nude like a Samantha Fox
Listen dude, but I got dollars and cents
You don't gotta promise me to pay my rent
I got that
Catch me in a drop black, playin' Speedy Gonzalez
Toes never unpolished
The way I be dressin', dudes wanna toss the salad
The way I be dressin' got broads actin' childish
But I pay my own bills
Amil-lion always has and always will
Y'all got that?
Think I need you 'cause the rent is due?
You can be outta here, baby (Baby)

Phone still dials out
Money still long, but my patience got shorter (Oh)
You can leave me, but gimme everything I bought you
Like you leavin' me was some type of torture (Oh)

Acting like my peeps, but I know that's how you tricked me
Love to see me get high, love to see my tipsy
Heard you even wanna stick a little chip in me
You been trying to play me close ever since my shine
Wanna take me to dinner, feed me shrimp and swine
You said, ""Amil I want you to meet a good friend of mine
His name is Money and we partners till the end of time""
Introduced me to your clique, hate, envy, lust and greed
Said you want the whole world in ya custody
And if I give you my soul you'll give me luxuries
Said you could hit me up wit power, it's just up to me
I turn you on when I'm in short skirts and tight jeans
You want my kids to write Santa and celebrate Halloween
Told me sell my people crack and get rich off fens
You love the number 6 but hate the number 13
Chorus: 
We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me
You wanna, be the one to pick me up when I fall
Told me hang Casear Borgia on my living room wall
It was always something bout you that made my skin crawl
You turned me into a player and showed me how to ball
You give me rewards when I rob and steal
Want me to abort my babies and get on the pill
You put burners in the hood so each other we kill
I see your eye watching me on the dollar bills
When I got the scoop on you, it just made you mad
Cause I moved out your crib, packed all my bags
Them days I turned to you was the days you laughed
You used to smile every time I pledge allegiance to the flag
We speak now and then but we ain't smacking hands
You be up in the clubs asking me for a dance
Still trying to convince me to go cheat on my man
Begging me to please give you just one more chance
Chorus:
When we was kids you was the one who taught me how to lie
Said I could always use you as my alibi
And you kept me from knowledge, wisdom, and the most high
Had me believe God had blonde hair and blue eyes
Our relationship went sour since I found the truth
You know you can't have me so you fuck with my youth
You got all my phones tapped, I gotta talk at booths
I learned an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
You built Sodom and Gomorra for us all to live in
When we was cool you used to tell me all your visions
Like how you gonna rule the nations under one religion
You got this New World order, it's like a big prison
You said you wanna be worshipped from noon to noon
Nothings gonna get better is what we all assumed
Cause nights is getting shorter and it's snowing in June
I see you working overtime cause you out of here soon

Yeah i know, and you can't stand your baby mother, right
Oh, you never felt this way before, huh
Wanna keep me in the gucci stores, huh
What happened to them minks and the diamond rings
Lying ass nigga, you ain't buyin me things
Nigga don't tell me I'm your flyest bitch
If i can't get the keys just to drive the whip
If i ain't the one you take on the private trips
If you got it like you say you do then provide them chips nigga
Chorus
We'll always be togetha
No one can fuck you betta
Yeah nigga i heard this all before
Yeah nigga i heard this all before
Yeah nigga you drive me crazy
I wanna have your baby
Yeah bitch, i heard this all before
Yeah bitch, i heard this all before
I thought you ain't like rap
You was deceiving me
All you do all day is watch BET
Actin like you ain't recognize when you met me in the ride
Mispronouncing my name, squinting your eyes
You shouldn't play games wit pimp like i
Now that i gained you, I'm supposed to sympathise
Yeah i know, you hait parties and you never go out
Yeah i know, you a nun and you stay in your house
Yeah i know, well can you please do me this favor
How you been with three rappers and six ball players, tell me that
Shit, we both gamin eachother
Lying through our teeth, both blaming eachother
I tried to front on you i take you to my rest
You tried to front on me actin like you ain't impressed
I'm tryin to see if the coochie's propa
You trying to score your self a gucci parka
And that new shit from prada
You tryin to get a rich baby father
I'm tryin to forget you by tomorra
This ain't rocket science
Ain't no rock buyin, just a hard rock lyin
And stop frontin like your shit is real
You get your game from oprah and lauryen hill
And if you are a nice girl, and i read you wrong
Look, I'm sorry if i lead you on, ok
Nah nigga, you ain't got to apologize
I knew that bitch want your cousin on your father's side
I mean damn, you don't even let me answer your cell
I mean damn, why i still got to ring the bell?
I find girl phone numbers and you say they your mans
When i call you don't even know who i am
So you can go ahead wit all that game you throw me
Don't tell me, motherfucka show me

Is in the arms of the man upstairs
Through trials and tribulations
He'll always be there
You see I know he loves me
And I know he cares
And he'll bever put more on me
Than I can bear
Is it a blessing to live or a blessing to die?
Let me finish out this hell with no questions why
I should be happy I'm on and dressing fly
But is the game changing me for the extra pie
If you could look into the life I live
Three sixty catching up to all the trife I did
Got my people up north trying to slice the bid
While I'm in love with a nigga with a wife and kid
Maybe if my pops ain't abandon me
I wouldn't let so many niggas take advantage of me
Using me some even put their hands on me
I wonder what the most high got planned for me
My life line getting shorter when I look in my palms
Swore I'll be nothing like my biological mom
She ain't raise me so naturally I never felt a bond
At 16 got my GED never saw a prom
I been weak and I been strong
I been through the fire, I been through the storm
Try to do right and I know I do wrong
Just be happy for me when my life is gone
Cause no more hurt and no more tears
There'll be no more pain and no more fears
No more people in my face that's not sincere
So smile 4 me when I'm no longer here
At a young age I let the world turn me out
Pellets and purple haze been burnt me out
A hard knock life is all I learned about
Trying to eat the only thing I be concerned about
Telling my youth everything happens for a reason
Let him know ain't that his father wanted to leave him
If it wasn't for the streets he'd still be breathing
Trying to raise him myself but I know he need him
Me and my seed used to live off mostly welfare
Only two checks a month for us both to share
I remember making sure that the coast was clear
So I could boost us some muthafucking clothes to wear
Had to hustle cause them food stamps just wasn't enough
Upstate back to Broadway gott to go re-up
All this fast cash only turned the heat up
Can't afford to get knocked but who gonna feed us
Chorus
Can't shake these thoughts of suicide
Anyone I ever loved or was close to died
Ones I trusted or thought was being true lied
A lifetime of tears but only a few I cried
Try to take my past stick it up on a shelf
But my actions stem from all the pain I felt
I'm just trying to make the best out the hand I dealt
If I fall who can I turn to for help
Hope my man with me or with my health
Will he be there through good and bad sickness and health?
Does he want the real me or somebody else?
I been in wars just so I don't jurt myself
Now that I'm on most can't stand me now
They was happy when I rocked all them hand me downs
When I need them funny how they can't be found
That's why the most high's my only family now

When I was milkin' out trix like cereal
Fuck a Chon Don Nectar Imperial
Treat me right I'll show you wifey material
Never would of thought we'd get down like this
Said you never been this happy til you found this bitch
At the Ritz countin' stacks like pounds was flipped
In the morning go shoppin let me bounce the 6
Get a kiss on the lips when I'm around your clique
Get the feeling one day you'll be crownin this
You inspire me to lace all the nouns I spit
Compared to you them other cats don't amount to shit
Always kept it wet like Bangladesh
Turned me out like mesh when you spank the flesh
Got me rotten tricken 50% and bank the rest
Your name chipped out on my tennis anklet
Chorus:
You treat me right
You make me smile
I know you care
No one could compare
You show me love
You got my back
You always here
No one could compare
Ain't no nigga like the one I got my nigga
And that's from the heart my nigga
Cuz you brought me from the slums to the top my nigga
Show these bitches what you got done to my watch my nigga
Ain't a millionaire who could take your place
Got me screamin out your name when we shake and bake
Who dat on the other line nigga? make em wait
Everybody told me don't fuck wit you
But despite all the rumors I'm in love with you
Nothing's ever too little or too much for you
If you ever leave I wouldn't know what to do
Shit you for me open like the bank accounts
Started screenin calls, stopped hangin out
Everything about you got me blankin out
You keep satisfied plus franklyned out
Repeat chorus
You think you was the first to ever make me nut
Be callin you daddy like you raised me up
Maybe one day we'll have a lil baby us
Growin up listenin to jay-z and stuff
Cuz what we are- is a perfect combo
We done come too far- to let this go
It ain't gotta be a star- to be in my show
When my man needs me I run to it
When my man calls me I jump to it
Give up everything if it come to it
Got a ring on my left hand with lumps through it
You my best friend, confidon, other hand
Up in the bubble bath, makin each other laugh
I doubt,- if I could ever give anotha the ass
Ya'll mad- cuz this ain't what most lovers have

Didn't think you wanted to do me
Started taking me to dinner and the movies
Had me open off the minks and jewelry
Buying me things that you know I wanted
Begging me for loving and you know I fronted
Now we doing more then getting blunted
And we both know we shouldn't of done it
Because wifey  at home and that's a no, no

She could feed the kids and wash the clothes
She could cook dinner and mop the floors
Just keep giving me a lot of doe
And give me some loving before you gotta go
Once you get home your girl be beefin'
Wondering where you was this weekend
Her cousin told her that she seen us creepin'
I guess by now she know you cheatin'
She must of found my number cause she calling me
Couldn't talk cause her man was all in me
Told her call me back at a quarter to three
Now that's the way real players ought to be
Shall I tell her bout the S he ordered me
So hy you fuckin' with him?
Cause he can afford me

It was the money that made me get with you
But right now I'm trying to get rid of you
Cause you always at my house like I live with you
Wanna lock me down like I got kids with you
See I knew from the gate that you was taken
If I told you that I loved you, I was only faken
Shit it ain't like that I wanna keep you
But I'll beep you when I need you
Now who getting played better you than me
Cause I know you could never be true to me
If you did it to her you could do it to me
Start slippin' and you might be losing me

Smuggled in the package tight
I'm 98 a gram leaving attics nice
I get 5 you dont get half a mic
Been known to cut ass for the added hype
And I pop too much shit to be the marriage type
Get spoiled even when I'm not acting right
Can't nobody come with the style I bring?
Piece hanging on the chain just a dangling
Motorola 2-way so the cell don't ring
Crush R&B and I don't even sing
No reference and no pro tools
Till I'm up in my hersh
I'm a show and prove
Got up in the game and made my own rules
Put heat on the reels until I blow the fuse

All Money is Legal Baby
And what, and what
All Money Is Legal Baby
What 'chu thing, what 'chu know abut this

The hotter the rhyme

Shoes got to be Gucci wht the fresh pair on
Spend up doe til its damn near gone
Lay it down get spins all year long
You know I run through them papers quick
You know I rock them glaciers sick
Chilling waiting for these shares to clear
I'm the only hot bich you gonna hear this year
You know I ass kick with no practice
Any joint I'm on automatic classic
Niggas pay me just to do ad-libs
And I move the crowd like I move to Saks Fifth
If I'm a gonna flash rocks then I'm a stash Glocks
If I'm a gonna talk shit
Then I'm a walk it
All money is legal now
I'm with Hov, Bleek and Sigel now

Give me my cue and I'm ready to roll
Take a little ghetto celebrity stroll
Floss with the minks to heavy to hold
Baggettes be whoa, I gets me doe
I'm an uptown swinger
With the light blue on the pinkie finger
Amilliyon 'bout to shake some ass
I'm crack packed in till it break the glass
Keep crates of papes, in the steel encased safe
Watch doe accumulate like real-estate
And you know I gotta keep tricks up the sleeve
Leav'em bankrupt with blue balls till the dick bleed
Save all receipts write it off quickly
If I'm a ball I'm play up in the big leagues
Never fold when the pressure come

36098,Amil,Y’all Dead Wrong,"Amil outlaw fly indeed
Got every chic's man eyeing me
Think you could crush this try and see
Its the major coin i-n-c
And am too hot to just be warm
I start fire alarms from dusk to dawn
Catch me with the diamond clusters on
And Gucci feathered sandals with the mustard thong
Model Mommy
The body like a cola bottle mommy
Mulatto up in the galoino mommy
One in a Amiliyon killin' em
Might have to change my name to billioyn
Voice so ill you'll wanna speak my shit
Joints so hot you'll wanna leak my shit
Plus haters sneak peek my shit
But still I be the only one to freak this shit
Y'all dead wrong
If you think you fuckin' wit this
And you'll know
That y'all got nothing on this
Y'all want that
Or you want something like this
Those who hate
Yeah y'all just fronting on this
Why chicks don't wanna rap on the same song as me
You need a verse ma, its on me
See all this publishing belong to me
Just imagine how the second album gonna be
Non-stop party hopping
Roc roc rocs and keep on rocking
Everything I spit be popping
Anything Amiliyon want she copping
(Whoop Whoop) Ain't nothing change
And I play more ballers then them rucker games
Light gray studs, ring, watch, plus the chain
Will I ever be broke what's my name?
Have you ever seen a chick like this?
Ever heard one spit like this?
I dead 'em all put my word on that
All money is legal and I murder tracks
Chorus
Cute as a button
Can't tell this bitch nothin'
Ghetto fab whole click bubbling
Diana Ross the boss of the rock
Shit  you know me I got to floss at the spot
Wit a dime as nigga who be tossing knots
Every bitch hating cuz I'm scalding hot
It can't be because I got begets on
Cause niggas love this bitch even with seats on
I'm the A-m-i-l-liyon
Strictly be on that shit major coins be on
I got joints making competition wanna drop dead
I got joints making you bop your head
I got joints that will have your eyes blood shot red
Fuck the doe I want my props instead
Stay real with it
Might pack stell wit it
You can hate but you still gotta deal wit it

36099,Amil,Anyday,"Call this bitch yor nigga when time is rough
I lost a lot when you fell, life is hard to bluff
You think its hell where you at
Shit its hell on the streets
You maintaining in the Bing, I'm surviving to eat
Don't think am wilding, flexing whips and stuff
Thinking I'm lost laying down
Sex for trips and stuff
I'll admit it I'm use to the finer things
We had major names even on the minor things
Everywhere we went, mad bitches sizing me up
You know they tight now, shit I get to drive the trucks
But I wish you were spreading it riding it rough
I think I miss that more then you buying me stuff
Since you got knocked your man tried to hollar at me
And those nigga's you stuck, they throwing dollars at me
But you know this gaming, and Im just keeping it real
Holding you down until you back on the field
Feels like I do
I feel when feeling down
In the ground feeling down
It can be most anyday
Don't worry 'bout these streets I'm conrolling these grounds
I might slip and miss a V-I but I'm holding it down
Got the kids to take care its hard out here
And its tearing my heart to play my part out here
I seen that snitch and you know I got plots 4 years
And your bid make me feel like I got the chair
But ain't nobody tapping this I rather tap my own
Watching tapes we made while I'm resting alone
Wishing you home, pictures of you flipping the chrome
What kind of chic will leave her man when he out the zone
Me without you is like a stickman without a silencer
Got me X-ing off days on the calendar
I miss loading the Glock so you could control the block
I miss watching you work the dogs to tighten the lock
Think of the time boo pushing it like a 6 double o
You get your weight up I'm a drain you once they let go
Chorus
I can see us back on the bricks, me on your shoulder
Letting bitches know they wishes to have you are over
So you ring your broads while you locked away
I know its hard for a nigga on top not to play
See Amil's the one you kept draped in ice
I'm the one waiting silk down caked in spice
Waiting for your calls or my box to vibrate
Hoping you want me to come scoop you not being more weight
I fell from Gucci sandals back to no name brands
From a six and a mansion to beating the sands
Staying true make ends meet to have enough for the love I take
All-savage and stuff
Have a brick where most F.E.D.S. dare to touch
Fear none to see the cash, and us popping the clutch
Chopping a Dutch-flip cop twice as much living low key
A minute then heist and stuff
If I have to wait while you gone I'm a take what comes
If you don't see cash, know its hard in the slums
Cause I ran through the stash and it ain't no funds",540,,confident,0.900,"""['success', 'dominance', 'resilience']""",0.700,"{""id"": ""6TwXGfSYPW4iRt9LXc71AT"", ""name"": ""Anyday"", ""album"": {""name"": ""All Money Is Legal""}, ""artists"": [{""id"": ""6NzM38IkXdbQsQ4qW9CG7z"", ""name"": ""Amil""}], ""explicit"": true, ""popularity"": 4, ""duration_ms"": 248493, ""preview_url"": null, ""release_date"": ""2000-09-19"", ""external_urls"": {""spotify"": ""https://open.spotify.com/track/6TwXGfSYPW4iRt9LXc71AT""}, ""migration_date"": ""2025-09-24T08:51:16.074132"", ""migrated_from_sqlite"": true}",2633,58,9.310344827586206,amil,chill,success,0.700

Here it comes, blaze the eye of da storm
Never saw me comin, but I made sure you was warned
In the blaze, I'm runnin gun high soundin the horn
See my niggas never run a negative 4
When I see you stuntin, give me what I need or I take it
Fuck game
Pass the blame ain't no need to be fakin
Muthafuckas wanna bring it to the point where I'm breakin
Feel the wrath in the heart, nigga ain't no mistakin
You gon wait until it calm and the size of the rain
There they go, swallow pride like you swallow my pain
Where da grain? Feel my fire, don't you wish it was tamed?
Cake ain't the same, playa, keep on yellin my name
So they, made the cards I was delt in the game
Take it how you give it, many keep abandonin the blame
Based on how you livin, fuck me's nothin the same
3-6 pimpin at the market knew I came

My bitcheeeesssss, light it up and don't stop

My bitcheeeesssss, light it up and don't stop
They gon know we real when we let the guns pop
My niggggaaaazzzz, light it up and don't quit

Sumpin's bout to jump off
I can feel dis, safteys come off
In tight situations, weak niggas run off
Done off, when the guns go off
Blaow, bout to light shit up
Quicker than cops write shit up
If it get too hectic then you might get stuck
Locked and tied up
While the, key players still the key players
Never burn bitches cuz you might need favors
1-7 cat stacked in 3 layers
All dem house rider mouth, fought to see neighbor
Suspects, what the fuck now?

Rude relationships wit those who cut checks
I want what I want

Escolhi-te no meio de todos eles
Dentre muitos olhos decidi
Olhar para os seus
Mas agora vejo-te desconfiado
Estás inseguro e achas que sou muito pra ti
Mas foi o teu carácter que me conquistou
E outros pormenores que me cativaram
Tipo o teu abraço que me desmonta
Teu beijo me recompõe
E eu quero
Eternizar contigo
Então deixa pra lá essas bocas
Que não nos subtraem, nem nos somam
Deixa pra lá esses terceiros
Que só nos querem ver infelizes
Deixa pra lá ...
Baby vem cá
Deixa fluir o Amor
Que temos para nós
(Para nós)
Não olha não
Não escuta aí por Alto
São invejos e tudo que querem é nos ver mal Amor
Eu não te quero perder...
És tudo que eu sonhei...
Em ti me encontrei Amor
Pois foi o teu carácter que me conquistou
E outros pormenores que me cativaram
Tipo o teu abraço que me desmonta
Teu beijo me recompõe
E eu quero
Eternizar contigo

Quero ser o teu melhor amigo
Quero estar junto a ti

I can break it down like whatever you want
I can break it down like whatever you want
All Glocks down, arriving is the bulletproof lyricist
All rude boy, big up, now hear this
I'm classic like a Coca-Cola, why don't you roll a L
And make it spiffy?
Are the L's twisty? Oh yes, let's get lifty
Long live the rugged female Heather B
So all you gun waving niggas put down your Glocks, please
No need for playing the hard anymore
The bulletproof lyricist is knocking at your door
So open up, let me in, let's get nasty if you wanna
I'll freak dat butt like a film by Heather Hunter
Touch you, cut you, I might just buss you
Buss your shit MC turned pretty
East coast, kid, how I swing
Bounce to Brooklyn
No need to tell you what I partook in
Just know Heather B. is back in town
It's no question, all Glocks down
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Walking with my middle finger up, brown Timbs steppin' through
Coming soon to a corner spot near you
It's the sidewalkin' rap talkin'
Hip-hop sister, no need to try me, mister
You got rhymes, go for it, we need no chorus
Freestyles comin' from the door
And who's testin' the untestable? Style's flexible
You gonna have to bounce, twelve rounds
TKO by the third, fuck what you heard
I didn't feel like playing around
'Cause you's part-time with a part rhyme
Committing no crimes and claiming to be hard on the block
So feel my funk, my beat, my vibe
Recognize that I'm live, all live, you know the time
Kid, just raise up, rise up, open your eyes up
Already got you sized up, so wise up, bitch
A L to the neck, a double deuce of Becks
And now my mind's set, I'll be rowdy to the death
Do us part, one love rock crew, right here in heart
Don't even play me, son, you'll get did, done
Turnin' all gats or guns
I'll leave your shorty with her hair undone
And then you know Heather B. is back in town
So no question, all Glocks down
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
I got my peeps to my left side and then my right
Can't wait until tonight when real niggas turn trife
I love the orange light from the Dutch Master tip
My whole crew bent, a half a hunnid gone, spent
Chocolate Thai, true dat, yo, who him?
Who dat snatchin' up da L like a sniper?
Son, you will surely miss the next cipher
If you ever try to hog up the L again
Last one to put in, first son to dig in
Now I hear you riffin' me while I'm countin' your tokes
The Hen-loc burns my throat with no chaser
I'm feelin vibes by my hip from the black pager
Blowin' up for the nine-four or the nine-five
For da nine square, either way, say word-word
Heather B. is in there to the most high
And to the most def no quest', all Glocks down
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound

36105,Heather B,My Kinda Nigga,"My Kinda Nigga Lyrics
We gon' talk about some THINGS.. we all can relate to
(Firing Squad up in the motherfuckin house) Yeah, whassup?
(Whattup nigga? Ha ha!) You got live motherfuckers in the house
(No doubt, no doubt) Holdin it down for my homey
(The homies nigga) Yeah (Put it on)
 The type of individual that seek out ways to stack mad figures
 My kinda nigga!
 The type to shut down the main man just to make his game plan bigga
 My kinda nigga!
 And when you scheme, he ready to move, much more quicker
 My kinda nigga!
 So when you flip and he slip the clip in then he rely on the trigga
 My kinda nigga!
Let me just hit you off (HIT 'EM!) with the real
My steel sing like opera, and open your fuckin head like a doctor
(DO WHATCHA GOT-TA) Holdin it down for (NEW YORK CITY)
We'll blow back your whole rap comittee
My Squad knock, make you wannabe hardrocks smoother
And move ya, with itchy trigger finger maneuvers
(You best get your steel) for these B-Ville sluggers
Cause gun shells really tell who shot motherfuckers
You gon' need protection when flexin, word to mother
I'm the reflection of my deceased brother
Flows are metamorphosed, keepin you hoes rippin off clothes
Smokin you soft hoes with or without a fo'-fo'
(HEART COLD AS THE NORTH POLE) And I be bangin 'em and tamin 'em
Crackin your cranium is Lil' Fame and them
(BLAOW!) The ill steel hitters
(FIRING SQUAD, FIRING HARD) My kinda niggas!
 The type of individuals that smoke trees and pour mad liquor
 My kinda nigga!
 The type to tighten up your whole mouthpiece if ya talk gets slicka
 My kinda nigga!
 Get 'cho crew, bring them niggas through, mines still thicker
 My kinda nigga!
 See when you peel, to those that real, cause we see the big picture
 My kinda nigga!
I'm fuckin with those East coast niggas packin that (BLUE STEEL)
That love they shorties rugged with they eyes and hair real
BIG UP to Brownsville, BIG UP to Jerz them niggas love me
I rhymes for respect them niggas know I stay hungry
From the, other side of the Hudson water
A nigga's daughter on some aw (FUCK IT TYPE ORDER)
Caught a charge pissin bitches off somethin decent
Now find me WILDIN at the 54th precinct
I fucks with niggas with braids and with no cuts
Niggas that'll pull a heist and split 'cho front
Puttin plugs in fake thugs hollerin street
I'm devil-eyed from lye and two hours of sleep
Bitch niggas walk around like they RUGGED
Stacks of boom bap and I know you don't want it
I'm a wild nigga (WHAT?) Crack the Heine', twist the dutch
My type of niggas just stay fucked up
 The thug nigga, bugged nigga quick to slig a slug nigga; that's
 My kinda nigga!
 The con artist, never let a nigga part us, the hardest; that's
 My kinda nigga!
 The game man ready to do yo' thang man, love Lil' Fame man; you're
 My kinda nigga!
 The stress cat hard blessed cat lead yo' niggas to the death that's
 My kinda nigga!
Here's a nigga that's no joke
All-American gunslinger that's dead broke
The thug nigga that's stuck on the frontline
Case you thought duck?  Buck, sparkin a nickel nine
Never regret what he did
Nigga flip a eight month sentence to a TWELVE YEAR BID
Be Presidential in your residential
Show them niggas what you into, use your potential
Slang yo' dope nigga (SLANG YO' CRACK)
Go on! (THAT'S WHERE IT AT!) That's where you get it at fool
Yo' kinda nigga (love) yo' kinda nigga (trust)
My kinda nigga is the NIGGA THAT'S GON' BUST
Landbruiser, beasts don't believe in 'em
Ghetto niggas be squeezin all motherfuckin season
Gun-totin motherfuckers, you figure
Them grimy niggas from the bad block

If headz only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd know - I ain't goin' out
If headz only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd know - I ain't goin' out
Yo, yo, if headz only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd know - I ain't goin' out
""I'm Every Woman,"" like Whitney, and Chaka
I sparks the green lye, the choc' thai, that good ganja
I stay mad bent, twisted up like a pretzel
Rainin' on hoes in weak shows like Tempest Bledsoe
My head so heavy, heavy-headed, heavy-handed
It be these wild niggas that I roll and stand with
I be rhymin' 'til dusk, bout trials and triumph
My grill be like what? Niggas know, I don't give a fuck
I stay in touch with the streets, the corners
Employed by the people, start slackin', a goner
You wanna know why I keep it real, 'cause it's easy
Fuck the fancy shit, it's the simple things that please me
I sports fat gear, along with no name shit
As long as I got me some cash, I don't care who name on my hip
I'm doin' shit for noventa-seis
That's nine-six in Spanish, why don't your wack ass vanish

They'd know - I ain't goin' out
If headz only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd know - I ain't goin' out
Demolition done, competition none
Reputation unsung strong long ground what
I got verbals, got herbals, and antihistamines
I'm herbally and verbally distributin' you listenin'
It's more to it, than a Lex and duplex
Don't sell sex or 'mote sex sells, I got more respect
Dressed in jeans, Gortex and striped rugbies
With the strength of fifty-four niggas, word, that love me
Hoes ain't ready for the shit I got
And, when I finally rock, they'll see I turned it up a notch
No more comin', but yo' crack is wide open
Or try to be hardcore, claimin', you totin'
I hope that you be hopin', when I'm rhymin', I'm jokin'
My tech', is more complex than weed smokin'
Senile, it's time that I get more agile
Style versatile, fuck doin' a minute, in the penile
Attitude hostile, intelligently hostile
Not just the rhymes but my frame of mind will drop you

They'd know - I ain't goin' out
If headz only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd know - I ain't goin' out
To all the doubters, givin' they opinion
My rhyme style winnin' so I'll just keep spittin'
Yeah, I'm just nasty like that and I don't give a fuck no more
Fuck that herb and his whore, 'cause yo
In my last game of freestylin' I dropped fifty
They did me none, mad jump shots and add ones
And then the tech', for bringin' bitches down by they neck
Yo, stop it, now there's no need to get wrecked
You play wild, but my style was flagrant and it's foul
I'll have you wipin' shit wit'cho white towel
I crashed yo' bust cause you don't think when you shoot
That made it way back downcourt and caught a ill alley-oop
Ooh! Heather B, y'all ain't know I get up
Plus I make my lay-ups, so, all you hecklers, shut the fuck up!
A team player, strategy, the full court press up
A fat jersey and a baggy short gets
Yeah, I even spotted 'em ten and did damage
Let them pick the refs, plus they had home court advantage
But even then, I'm not one to underestimate
So, the whole forty-eight, I banged out in the paint
And when it all was put on the line
Tied score, second left in double overtime
These bitches went and fouled me, they must not know
That in the clutch, Heather B was gon' sink both free throws

They get blasted when I'm lickin off, Heather B
Hard hitter, when I'm gettin off, these bitches
With no father figures they be trickin off, feel me
They beez off the heez knees and naps to show
If they try to run between these I blow they doors
Put the jinx on em all like they sophomores
Cause these bitches got the gall to holla hardcore
I'm crackin jaws, Heather B the southpaw, with no look
Give a fuck about these bitches, uhh, and that's the hook
You know how I'm gon' get it, split it, off the books
And you ain't got to love me, trust me, simply put

When you countin on your peoples and they don't pull through
I'ma do me (you gots to do you)
Niggas game so weak I can see right through
I'ma do me (you gots to do you)

See you out there gettin yours, gots ta gets mine too

You feel me now?  You get the point?
Heather B B B B drops oowops on your joints
You really, can't rate me or mistake me for another
I Brings In Da Noize And Funk like Savion Glover
Wicked, like those sisters and that stepmother
Got your clocks strikin twelve I'm bringin hell to Cinderella
Fuck how much you sell cause, I read your album cover
You couldn't write a jam if your last name was Smucker
Got all my motherfuckers yellin Jersey up in here
No Limit like Master P I like how he Do Dat There
Listen here I'm livin sort of dan-gerous-ly
Plus I'm bulletproof no use in aimin at me
Chorus
I spits pure fire, I burn the finest of designs
Heather B that MC that runs up on em from behind
Who got your back now, where you ill crew at?
The sons you talked about with guns, the ones with gats and all that?
I figured that some rap for plaques over, R&B tracks
You got to watch, what you say if you ain't really, livin that
Another rapper lost, lookin all stank up in The Source
What's all that shit fo'?  Did your momma, raise a hoe?
Fight it, and I win, I'm that rhyme, veteran
With that Nighttime Sniffly Sneezin Rest Your Head, Medicine
See me live rock on Keenan, and even, Letterman
Rock Chris Rock, blow his spot, like nitro-glycerin
Hold that like they don't know, but I'm like years ahead of them
Plus I shed, more light right, than Thomas, Edison
And I'll take it there end your career with one stroke of my pen
And I got enough love, I don't need no mo' friends

When they poppin champagne and you only drinkin brew
I'ma do me (you gots to do you)
When you know you broke as hell and your rent is due
I'ma do me (you gots to do you)

I only want niggas and shorties to know me
They feel what I feel and they talk what I talk
I gotta please heads in New Jerz and New York
Move me from my post when I'm strictly East coast
Recognize the most thoroughest, word is bond
Armored clips of lyrics and stacks of steel tracks

I done stopped, and folded this shit, now I'mma seal it
Shorty, you better stay clear of my direction
Servin verbal detention all day, and every day
Now who was it that said females can't rhyme? I'm witchu
That's why real niggas got to keep this shit true
It's those Beck's and Heineken's I crack from time and time again
That keeps me rhymin, while the rest of them, be home sleepin

From now on I'm makin moves, fuck plans
That's the shit I'm on as my front door slams
And fuck these neighbors, they'll never understand
But one day I'm gonna make 'em all big fans
Turned on my light and took my coat off halfway
Then sat down and sparked up the roach in the ashtray
Plugged up my beats and took off my Nikes
No kids in my crib, hip-hop gives me life

I pray every day a stray bullet won't take me

I got the hots for fat knots and drop tops
I'm gonna be more than a girl with a hair shop

I'm goin for my shot at this game called hip-hop
I'm gon stop all the Heather-cannots
With a box of can-dos and all types of what-nots
And read my label when I enter the room
Yo, believe that I'm deadly once consumed
There comes a time when people go shine
When they wanna act up, yo, I just start takin mine
True indeed, this was inspired by the weed
Then empty another dime with hardly no seeds
My daily deeds I need for cheese all day

And government won't be controllin our housin

The fattest cars we wanna ride around in
Goretex boots ( ? ) on the terrain
Our lands in the sand cause some things don't change
Act up and you'll join Ms LaBelle

Footprints remain on the backs of pirates
That aim to invade my purple place

Speakin with no speech impediments
Cause a king once stayed strong
In the state pen-itentiary believe we
Gonna hold down JC
We be the next new niggas, we goin for it all

36111,Heather B,Sendin ’Em Back,"Prod by Kenny Parker.
(Sendin kids back to the lab for mo' practice) -- E-Swift
(So recognize when you feel it) -- Diamond D
Bystanders better duck, somebody better call police
Another Heather B freestyle done hit the streets
Laced to the nines, my chrome-dipped rhymes
They gon shine, then blind your next weak-ass line
And aimed at your head is a infrared circle
Of sentences with messages that read 'Fuck you'
I chip tooths, knockin 'em lose at one time
That's for all them hoes that don't write they own rhymes
Repeat after me, 'Heather B, Heather B'
Lyrically, lyrically got all these hoes shook
What, you think you can't get yo title took?
You are not the type to even hold on much
You rhyme but I write, you fuss but I fight
I am all the truth and you are all the fuckin hype
I don't like no fake-ass MC
So any problems with that, you come see me
(Sendin kids back to the lab for mo' practice) -- E-Swift
(So recognize when you feel it) -- Diamond D
Now you can find me in Brooklyn but I'm a Jersey resident
The only sister station at the 54th Regiment
Heather  send me but I'm ghetto-sent
And I flips mad shit with the New York accent
Come at me if you can fuck up the other 53
And that wild nigga Walt got the heat
Up under the driver's seat I know he got a long gat
And I'd be a fool to tell you were the other toolie at
So all y'all with weak lines and jammed nines
I see that you missed the point in my last rhyme
Take off yo weak-ass frown, you ain't the man of your town
Yo nigga, I meant you when I said 'Glocks down'
Don't ever force me to have to flaunt it
I'm sayin if I ever grow a dick you'll be on it
I twist ya like a cap, split yo back like a dutchie
If you touch me, you can't touch me even if yo touch is Midas
I'm as  versatile as any nigga playin two sports
And all y'all brand new ideas already been my thoughts
Who wants the wrath of 50 niggas poundin that ass
I suggest you wave your flag and just call this shit quits

Listen to me get busy on this track, big shots to Kenny Parker
It sparked ya, marked ya, son, you'se marked for death
You gots to be more Man than Meth to fuck with Heath-
Er B, be breakin down styles quite simply
You're causin me, hold up, wait, bitches is forcin me
To show that I'm the ruggeder, I keep 'em turnin yellower
See me, say to yourself, ""I can't fuck with her""
My rowdy nuccas got all things covered, what!
Pick that time and that spot and we'll meet up
I'm leavin bitches beat up, tell yo nucca roll his weed up
Cause I'm yankin all you ass-stankin shorties
By yo teeth, so keep yo comments brief
The Lord-have-mercy's and the Oh-my-god's, plus the Please's
You'll be sayin to your Jesus when my rhyme style releases
So trick or lick a dick up, go find some fuckin work
Cause the only thing you gon' get around here is hurt
No doubt (No doubt)
(I fuck around and get hardcore) (hardcore) --] Biggie Smalls
Y'all remember 'Um Tang, Um Tang'?
Well now nuccas holler 'Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang!'
This be a Jersey thang-thang, nothin but street slang
Nothin but blunts hang from the lips of this lyricist
You try and diss, it's a mistake but I'll excuse you
Lose you, defuse you if you claim to be the bomb
Y'all corny mothereffers and y'all slick-talkin heffers
Y'all uppers and your lower lips need sewin together
Y'all talk more shit than Al Sharpton when the mic on
In person you'se a bitch with tight white panties on
Bitch-ass, trick-ass, you can't rhyme
Prepared me for take-off, I'm leavin niggas flatlined
( *flatline* )
I came with that eenie-meenie-minie-moe
And caught a sleepin rapper by the toe
I'm undisguised, you recognize me
In the black jacket and boots made by Polo
A sister that be rockin solo
Over Thorough-Ass Bo, Tone flows with the two followed by three zeros
In 2000 I ain't checkin for no heroes
I just wanna sit back and count mad dinero
And have the CREAM comin from my rear, yo
I speak crystal-clear, so I know that you heard me
Heather B be the one hollerin 'Jersey!'
Chilltown up in this piece
And the Coast be the motherfuckin East
No doubt (No doubt)
(I fuck around and get hardcore) (hardcore) --] Biggie Smalls
I wanna be more Illmatic than Nas
And have bitches breakin and 19in and maydayin like Das
EFX, I set, then set off, then re-set
Your whole sound set, your rhyme cipher or your blunt set
Shit, why you stressin me, ock, what I do to you?
Nothin gon' stop the rowdy type from puttin tools to you
Baggy Guess wear his ass tear us by the frame
Gettin ass to ass and smokin ganja by the basket
Rowdy bastards, we better batter up
It's time to leave more bodies splattered up
Let's gather up, round up 
Grab a Phillie and a touch of the invincible wideout
We gon' burn on three different crews, from three different hoods
I don't know who lied and told you it was all good
Not around here and that's word
Leavin teeth on the corner and ass on the curb

Word up
Big shots to my brother Jetta, Big Mal
I represent all them shorties universal
Word up son, no doubt
Now check it out
It don't be nobody but that rugged shorty
Fuck a 40 if I can sip Hennessy by the quartie
W-E-E-D spells relief
No dutchie, twist mines in a , let's steam, chief
I goes to the extreme, so proceed me with caution
That dime bag you left me last night, I burned this morning
So what up, nucca, what be left of yo stash?
I hope you hittin' ass better than that blunt you pass
It's gettin' deep, I'm goin' farther
But I peeped you puffin ganja, three L's left you traumin'
And what be up with that 'Uh, I'll spark that tree'?
I hope you ain't a nucca that's gon' fold on me, B
I wanna burn with you all night, then get live
Or we can blow up with that Sega, put in that Madden 95
And keep yo conversation short if yo cash is
Don't promise me lavish gifts and can't pull through
Yo gear, you gots to be a freshly-dipped nucca
From your Helly Hansen jacket down to the Hilfiger boxers
Word up son
No doubt
Heather B representing for all the shorties out here
What goes on, nucca, what be up
(What goes on, what goes on)
Just tell me, nucca, what goes on, what be up
(What goes on, what goes on)
And there'll be no hand-holdin till the lah gets rolled
Keep yo steelo real so no lies get told
Glassy eyes, my Timbos, they beige and untied
Levi's with no crease, Colombia hair band circle in my dome piece
Real nuccas love they hood to the fullest, let no man violate
Fatigue-wearing, chest-bearing, gettin' cheese out of state
Niggas got the block sewn up
Infiltrators want yo spot blown up
Yo, you hit if you slip, God, jewel piece is shining
Yo shorty love her diamonds
You stressing just to keep your shorty fly, I'm told
Fools gold you hold, let the snitches and the bitches go
One of them bound to be yo trip up north
Nigga glad to see you hype, shorty promise she gon' write
Funny how fate make a nigga wanna see whole
No snakes in yo pit and no bulls in yo shit
Is the only way respect gon' follow yo name
Nucca, what goes up, nucca, what be up
Word life son
On the real
What goes on, nucca, what be up
(What goes on, what goes on)
Just tell me, nucca, what goes on, what be up
(What goes on, what goes on)
What goes on, nucca, what be up
(What goes on, what goes on)
What goes on, nucca, what be up
(What goes on, what goes on)
And when were you when my lights went out
And my moms put me out and I slept on the couch
Check this out, I need no new friends, son
I runs with the nuccas that been down since day one
No gravy train ridin' on these tracks
And fuck all them jacks that's down after the fact
Just me and my wagon cause there's no draggin'
Dick-riders along, they won't miss me when I'm gone
Shorty starin' down to my shoelace
You gets the screw face, I heard all yo gossip
Jeru told you you can't stop a prophet
Now make sure yo topic is up to date
I'm spittin back at those doubters that spit at me
They forgot Heather B would eventually shine

Gonna rock you all night and it feels so tight
Steady Rockin' till the morninglight

Back the fuck up, pardon me
You lookin' for fame and rolls for play but I truly raise
I'm the queen of us and there's only one higher
I won't stop rockin', till I retire
You askin' me if I want it, my temperature's bubblin'

Tryin' to clown, walk around frontin'
Gangster this, gangster that till he got passed
Now we gotta run, and then you switch your pit
And turn straight, biatch! Beggin' me not to a breath word of it
But I'ma tell how you livin' how your style get different

My codename should be Fatal, my style is fatal
Quick to fade you if I have to face you

You lose cause nobody else could save you
Your crew don't make you, if that crew
Get hungrier than you do that same crew gon' hate you
It's me they relate to, lets get all the paper
So we ain't gotta be stressed till later
I can even make it racial, put it in black and white
The dough ain't right, got the right to the facial
A lot of y'all cradle, wet behind the ears
Followin' peers get hooked in you mama's label
But hey I don't blame you, this game is for big girls and big guys
Got no time to change you, but look here's what I can sum it all up
If you with me than you with me, if not shut the fuck up

I'm here for the long haul
Who stopping me from ballin like Chamique Holdsclaw?
Single, black female, outlaw
Most wanted
Hardcore, to make a brother want more
Put nobody on a pedestal
Too many garbage MC's, rap residue
E'rybody talking righteous ain't responsible
You so busy judging me, but God judging you
I know scriptures too
Play me? Doubt that
Gettin it? Bout that
I waited for the right one - it's crazy now I found that

Fresh off the red eye

Ripping, all mics

All these killers on wax sound stupid
Hope you're ready
Hope it wasn't the Henny cause you might have to prove it
Got fakers thinkin twice now
Cause the moment, of truth might be right now
I'm raisin e'rything from stakes, to eyebrows
So if you want in you gotta pay down 'pon in
Bet I came to move the crowd
Pity?
I had some
I read your story all over, it's a sad one
But you took a shot at me, that was mad dumb
My Sharpie ink spots like a magnum
You gon' catch a bad one
Your future?
Dismal

1 ContributorI Get Wreck Lyrics
I ain't one to gossip, but I heard your shit was wack
And I ain't one to brag, but this jam is fat
I won't push you to the extreme to say I'm all that
But if you have to ask, then you must think that
Don't understand what it means to be conceited
Never left a sentence or a verse incompleted
In a battle I won't get defeated
And I don't get mad, I get heated
Had to wreck the ones that wanted to fight me
Don't give a damn if nobody likes me
Never lit the likes of pipes or hype
I'm livin for me, myself and the mic
Love to rock Nikes and a dope sweat hoodie
You can't buy vinyl at no Sam Goody
Hip-hop DJ's, what will you do
Record companies don't know, when you do, buy two
They're killin hip-hop with ease
And I hate those damn cd's
Now let's talk about the birds and Heather B's
Sisters, don't allow yourself to get skeezed
And believe I got the mad self-respect
So recognize and understand my rep
And if you show me any disrespect
You better know that I get wreck
And I get wreck
(On and on and on and on)	--] Grand Puba
(Ugh! Ugh! Ugh)
I'm not a star, cause I don't shine
I'm a go-getter, cause I will go get mine
I ain't lazy, moody or shady
And I won't lie, but I am crazy
The same way I chill, I will ill
And I wanna beat you cause your ???? need a kill
I got skills and I don't pop pills
And no man can say that I want his diznills
I won't fix anything that's not broken
Rather jump the turnstyle than pay a token
I'm no criminal, I'm not crooked
But I can't say that I'll never do it
The Kenny Parker beats are just stupid
He finds the funky shit and he loops it
Adds the flavor, bass, hi's and snares
Books a studio session and I meet him there
I grab my lyrics and get a microphone check
And open my mouth, then commence to wreck
I used to get weeded, but now I hate the smell
So I stopped just to keep my braincells
Don't like the feelin of bein high
Like to stay down-low and write dope rhymes
If I gotta be high, it's high-paid
And it's not my style to high-profile
Not the only child, one of four
Thank God my pops was too broke to make more
So I make dough for me and the fam
I never know when they might need a helpin hand
Don't get me wrong, I never flash loot
And every now and then I sport my Doc Marten boots
Only in the winter do I wear Timbos
Never been called a broad or bimbo
Don't do the limbo cause it's corny
And I wish they'd sell Snapple by the 40
It took a while to get my album set
Now I'm here and I'm gettin wreck
Yeah, Heather B gonna give a few shout outs, you know

Peace to Biz Markie
Peace to Kid Capri

36117,Heather B,Nobody Knows,"Somebody dropped a jewel on me one time and I kind of forgot about it until I was going through something. He said it's a good feeling to get what you want but only a stupid fool hates to turn from evil. He said wise friends make you wise but you hurt yourself by going around with fools
At 23, had a business had friendships had a company
Glad to be on my own living lovely
If you needed anything it was on me
Souped(?) cars deep going on shopping sprees
And every week I bought the get highs and blew a g'
Met a thug fell in love weekends in A.C
Yo, when friends fell out with moms they stayed with me
If I ever needed, they said they'd do the same for me
Cause when friends is like your fam that's how it's supposed to be
Would've died for the large(?) ones close to me
You won't have to learn what I learned hopefully
It's quite plain that
Nobody owes yah, nobody calls yah
Nobody knows you when you out the game (x3)
Trouble with the label trouble with the business
Led to trouble with money and trouble with friendships
From ocean views to ghetto blues can't believe I played the fool
I should've cherished my jewels
Never knew my own peoples would turn so cruel
Except for a few the rest was like it's on you
Thought about school but I had dreams to fulfill
To many visions of doing the shows and seeing my name on the bill
Life got ill wise statistics gave me the chills
Found 9 out of 10 phony, that told me they was real
So I vowed, the next time I get on and get a deal
To lay stronger foundations and just build build build
Keep my head to the sky, and see God in pain
And never will I trust in chariots and horses again
Should've focused on my future but the moment was the aim
So whatever people did only me could I blame
Nobody owes yah, nobody calls yah
Nobody knows you when you out the game (x3)
Working on the low like a private dancer
But I know now that prayers get answered
Back on my feet it feels heavenly
Old faces looking like how can it be? Remember me
I'm the one you counted out the one you did doubt
The one you borrowed from then got sent about
The one you rejected the one you neglected
Is the same one now like reborn and resurrected
The one you denied now can't look in the eye
Cause I'm the one you spit on when I fell by the wayside
I'm the one you left bleeding the one you left grieving
But true soldiers go to war in any season
I suffered not in vain now prepare for the reign
Knowing it takes more than fortune and fame to truly maintain
But no matter how it change one thing remains the same

36118,Heather B,More Than The Music,"Must be the music that's turning me on
Don't wanna feel no more pain or hear another sad song
I'm sick of days where everything goes wrong
See I done hit rock bottom and life still goes on
Somewhere out there over the rainbow over the moon
There's a pot of gold and a silver spoon
I'm gonna eat soon
I'm all woman, may God bless my womb
To be fruitful and beautiful, opponents make room
The game is game but I will rise like the phoenix
And get to serving some of y'all like Serena
Like Venus
I've been misled and mistreated
I've overreacted, became heated, I blame the world and it's teachers
I pointed fingers and made a wishlist
Felt like the Grinch That Stole Christmas
And wished  on craft bitches in my mist
So as the  I feel it's on now
Here's where I belong now
It's more than the music (the music)
More than the melody
Never believe once what these fools try to tell me
It's more than the songs and the samples and the lyrics
I'm gonna go above and beyond any limit
Sticks and stones never broke my bones
But some of these critics tried to hurt me
What you gon' say now when I make the Power 30?
And live like everyday's my birthday
""Oh she must have a ghostwriter""
Nothing left to do but smile
I'm too experienced
I could battle for play play using my inner child on some of y'all
Running circles around your many styles
Leaping over MC's waving white towels in a single bow
Look up in sky
Heather B be the movement
Don't make me get rowdy and ruthless
Over something stupid
It's more than simple
I warn you, I can get on you and in you
And cleanse you and clean you
Ms. Thing I read you
Getting paid in the process
Separate the news from the nonsense
The chaotic from the conscious
The mentors from the monsters
The preachers from the prophets
The hook
It's more than the music (the music)
More than the melody
Never believe once what these fools try to tell me
It's more than the songs and the samples and the lyrics
I'm gonna go above and beyond any limit
On my thirteenth birthday, my wish was
A Casio keyboard, a quick buzz
Every critic in the hood knew who the kid was
Sneaking up on y'all just like the hiccups
Check it, Marley in control days, niggas sold treys
Now it's the Flex time, kick ya best rhymes
Toe to toe, neck to neck, down to the line
Can't talk about the best without mentioning mine
Cause I'm everything you wanted to be but just couldn't
Everything you wanted to see but just wouldn't
Everything you imitate and try to mimic
You need to stop trying to be me, go find a gimmick
Don't try to limit, multi-
When I honk the horn I got no time for bitches
Rather make money than be chewing the fat
With you, with ch'all and them dudes in the back
Like a breath of fresh air set to move to the track
You better change you D I'm the new running back
A lot of y'all is porn stars, niggas going hard
Knock niggas off guard on verbal assault charge
It's more than the music (the music)
More than the melody
Never believe once what these fools try to tell me
It's more than the songs and the samples and the lyrics

36119,Heather B,Gotta Love Me,"Gotta Love Me Lyrics
This be the situation:
He was the neighborhood kingpin!
I used to see how the  kids looked up to him
Half the chicks ‘round my way was in love with him
But the old folks done had enough of him
I used to wonder what was up with him
Never saw him make sale
And once I think I heard he did a few months in jail
But he kept lil Nick and them out on bail
With supply and demand  it wasn’t hard to tell
He was killin ‘em at retail!
One day I thought I’d speak
He sounded like L’s character from ‘Into Deep’
A lot of yes men around him cos they wanna eat!
A lot of scared cats around him, but they hold heat
They fire in a heartbeat!
Our conversation kinda had me
Had me wanting to know more about him pretty badly
Spent ‘bout an hour with him talkin and laughin
Even tho I hated what he did, somethin about him had attracted me…
Gotta love me, gotta love me
Gotta love me, gotta-gotta gotta love me, (wicked ways..)
Gotta love me, gotta love me
Gotta love me, gotta-gotta love me, (wicked ways..)
Gotta love me, gotta love me
Gotta love me, gotta-gotta gotta love me, (wicked ways..)
Then it all started to come clear
I remember he threw the illest party for the new year
Strictly champagne and cognacs…. No beer!
And for Valentines, he’d buy a rose for every single female out here
He got Tony his first beeper
And a lot of little shorties something  brand new for Easter
Didn’t flake when it came down to promises either
Told each kid if they got promoted – he’d buy ‘em all new sneakers
Summer time he did his thing
The nicest ballers wanted to play for his team
BBQs off the hook! Mad burgers and wings!
And a lot of his crew would come through from Brooklyn AND Queens
Halloween he treated of course
And for Thanksgiving – he made sure he fed the poor
Even if his crew had to bring turkeys door to door
So by the time Christmas rolled around, he was like a Black Santa Claus
Gotta love me, gotta love me
Gotta love me, gotta-gotta gotta love me, (wicked ways..)
Gotta love me, gotta love me
Gotta love me, gotta-gotta love me, (wicked ways..)
Gotta love me, gotta love me
Gotta love me, gotta-gotta gotta love me, (wicked ways..)
My curiosity grew thicker
And the life he was living  just got even bigger
The cars, the hoes, everything, the whole litter!
And even tho we wasn’t official yet, it was next on the agenda
Nothing seemed impossible
And wit him I felt unstoppable
He used to tell me, ‘Now everybody’s watching YOU!’
And I didn’t believe him until that day I got a call from the hospital
My little cousin had OD’d… Blacked out from mixin dip with weed
And the only reason why my fam was telling me
Cos I be with the cats that sold her that
For that they wasn’t feelin me
Can’t lie I felt provoked
Felt like they was mad at me cos my cousin smoked
It all just seemed like a twisted-twisted joke
Do I blame my friend or my cousin?
Tell me who’s at fault…
Gotta love me, gotta love me
Gotta love me, gotta-gotta gotta love me, (wicked ways..)
Gotta love me, gotta love me
Gotta love me, gotta-gotta love me, (wicked ways..)
Gotta love me, gotta love me
Gotta love me, gotta-gotta gotta love me, (wicked ways..)",603,,confident,0.900,"""['success', 'generosity', 'narrative observation']""",0.700,"{""id"": ""0t86g3SkTzJtvBZztHaD5B"", ""name"": ""Gotta Love Me"", ""album"": {""name"": ""Eternal Affairs""}, ""artists"": [{""id"": ""7qmtfLJzKBu8csTDXTEAph"", ""name"": ""Heather B""}], ""explicit"": true, ""popularity"": 5, ""duration_ms"": 222013, ""preview_url"": null, ""release_date"": ""2002-02-12"", ""external_urls"": {""spotify"": ""https://open.spotify.com/track/0t86g3SkTzJtvBZztHaD5B""}, ""migration_date"": ""2025-09-24T08:51:16.095816"", ""migrated_from_sqlite"": true}",3137,72,8.375,heather_b,chill,success,0.700

I'm not just another female rapper, It's much deeper
Break my name down, H-E-A-T-H-E-R
Heather Heater, B, has to B-E the truth seeker
Mama should've named me Malika
Means Queen in Swahili, I'm alot of y'all achilles
Sudden death wouldn't kill me
I was born to be born again I'm guilty
I middle finger Satan, I accuse America of rapin
I told labels, they was takin
So I slaughtered the pigs and kept the bacon, respect my greedy
I eat to live and speak freely, Color me Purple when I spit like Cely
On all you, misters and misses, I ain't never been nobody mistress
I'm a grown woman, even under the influence I know what I'm doin
I rhyme to reiterate the game ain't ruined, I'm a shoe end
Don't need Pradas or Louis to put a foot in
Your rectum, this is a warnin, and a lesson
Shot fired, I was listenin not retired
Got encouraged, then inspired
Not ignorant but ignited, my personal private
In the meantime REWIND what I salive it
I'm lookin to be inducted, not indicted
Now dare me to previal, in this climate, I'm flyin higher!!!
:
So high, yes I'm, climbin high, It's I
So high, yes I'm, climbin high, It's I
:
And I don't have a guilty conscience
So blame me for disposin the garbage and exposin the foxes
H be the monster, the most respected
Don't mean the most popular It's all what you optin for
Publishin I own it, my dreams I ran down own 'em
Chased 'em, 'til my wheels became donuts!!!
One mic, many components, lil' hood lil' educated all good, got my diploma
Like moms and my Coronas, love Good Times like Florida and Wilona
No weights on my shoulders, nobody was expectin me
So let me borrow a line, at this time from The D.O.C
The formula I got it, like playin spades and listenin to The Chronic
Like seein The Five Heartbeats and then goin back to really watch it
How ironic! The game ain't changed, egos still kill the artist
Who's reallyon the humble? Yeah we dogs
Long as one of us wears a muzzle, stay out of trouble
It's all so suddle, how they waste you then want you
You gots to keep your feet up on you
It's so so dirty, how they want you to smile and stay purdy
But ain't no deals after thirty
Who's worty? I'm worthy you respect me you deserve it
And I hope you, you, and you, heard me

t Stop Lyrics
Aw yeah! Hit the dancefloor! Get it in!
It don't matter, I keep makin music makin money
Stayin hungry cause the game don't stop
And it don't matter you can hate me you can love me
Stayin hungry cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter cause I'm good so what's goody
On my boogie cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter cause really y'all feel me
And I know that the game, don't, stop
They ask me how my skin get so thick my tongue get so slick
And why I seem so nonchalant
They ask me if I wrote all my songs am I a phenom
And when the last time I hit a blunt
They ask if I'm in it for the loot, or am I the truth
And if so, who got the proof?
They ask me if my marriage is real do I have sex appeal
And if I drink Cognac or (?)
They ask me where did I come from all of a, sudden
Who don't know that I been here the whole time?
They ask me what I think about her and what I think about him
Who don't know I only think about mine
Steady askin me to comment on things that have no bearing
On my life and what keeps me inspired
Just another game they play folks are funny that way
More trickery to keep us dividied
It don't matter, I keep makin music makin money
Stayin hungry cause the game don't stop
And it don't matter you can hate me you can love me
Stayin hungry cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter cause I'm good so what's goody
On my boogie cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter cause really y'all feel me
And I know that the game, don't, stop
They ask if I'm friends with this one or friends with that one
And tell 'em all the places that I freak with
They ask if I stole from someone, if I own a gun
And if so, is my shot pretty decent?
They ask me if I ever sniff, coke, sip, Coke
Or ever mix Coke, at all?
They ask if I'm a safe chick, a solve a case chick
Or do I like to bury traps in the floor?
They askin if I low-ride or ever skydive
And how far would I go to the extreme
They ask if I chain smoke or ever came close
To coughin up, information on my team
Steady askin if I beat, charges or ever read, blogs
Cause in at what point would I plead the fifth?
Askin if I do dirt, if I'm a big flirt
What part of the game is this?
It don't matter, I keep makin music makin money
Stayin hungry cause the game don't stop
And it don't matter you can hate me you can love me
Stayin hungry cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter cause I'm good so what's goody
On my boogie cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter cause really y'all feel me
And I know that the game, don't, stop
Still askin if I cried when Mike died, took oath and then lied
And where's the line between love and hate
They asked if I played cee-lo or if I hit below
The belt where my pride is at stake
They askin if I'm cold and edgy, right or lefty
And who really is my right-hand man?
Askin fio I hold grudges or follow hunches
And who security for all my Stans
They ask if I'm Giants or Jets, Yankees or Mets
Knicks or Nets, trash talk or place bets
If I'm commercial or jet, now or next
Raw dog or, safe sex
Steady askin if I play my cards or keep my guards WAY up
When the sharks start swimmin
But I don't tip my hand, I let it hit the fan
Cause really it makes no difference
It don't matter, I keep makin music makin money
Stayin hungry cause the game don't stop
And it don't matter you can hate me you can love me
Stayin hungry cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter cause I'm good so what's goody
On my boogie cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter cause really y'all feel me

The sautéer
The bulletproof full of vigor for all y'all niggas
I spent my winter in bubble gooses
Drinkin’ gin up with fruit juices
Loud music, mixin' fluids and herbs 'til my body refuse it
I blacked out a few nights, I had the chills, the sweats
I swore to the Lord, ""I’ll stop if I live to see the next""
Next cypher roll around again
I'm puffin' mad body bags and gettin' wild again
My people moundin' up, they marinatin' the fire shit
When it's my turn to burn, I'm blazin’ up and gettin’ wired
Escaping for a minute, my mishaps and plights
With a slight recollection of that last cypher night
But I'ma blaze a L in the air anyway like Nike
And if I die, bury me with no books and mics
Give my cash to my crew, split it 54 ways
Make sure y’all maintain, I might resurrect in three days
And when I come back, my objective is to strike with a vengeance
I'm paying pass without my proper dues or my respect, kid
Scorpion like Sticky
Instinct remains extra sharp and extra crispy
Get needles, get thread, it still can't fix me
You grab me by my tail, my deadly sting leaves you history

Drastic measures I'm takin' for those fakin'
I believe in revenge and no forms of retaliation
No negotiations once I get started
I represent the Big East, so recognize my conference
I'm confident, I wouldn't call myself cocky
Put my shit out myself when that last label dropped me
Fuck around this time and sell mad copies
And prove to them snakes they ran they whole shit sloppy
Watch me, have to be no gimmicks, no tricks
No niggas in the background writing my shit

36124,Ms. Dynamite,Dy-Na-Mi-Tee,"Dy-Na-Mi-Tee Lyrics
Yo, I'm that same little girl that grew up next door to you
Went through all the things a teenage girl goes through
Hangin' out all night and breaking my curfew
When my daddy hit the door, I gave my mumma the blues
Used to spend my time blazin', lazin' days away
Thought I was grown, left home at 15, didn't wanna obey
Had to get my act together, couldn't take the heat
And now I'm makin' beats for the streets
I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
I stay blowin' up your stereo
Everybody gotta hear me, yo
I'm just Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
Hear me bussin' on the radio
Now feel my flow, you get me though
I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
See me bouncin' in the video
And I come to rock the show
I'm just Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
Everybody lose control
Let my vibe touch your soul
I remember all the house parties that took place
Bein' in my bed upstairs and we could still feel the bass
And my cousins and my brothers, we'd sit up all night
Listenin' to my family vibin' till the mornin' light
Remember my first years of school, I was so innocent
I just wanted to learn, I never been so content
But the more that I learned, I found a guidin' light
That showed me the need to fight
And be
I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
I stay blowin' up your stereo
Everybody gotta hear me, yo
I'm just Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
Hear me bussin' on the radio
Now feel my flow, you get me though
I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
See me bouncin' in the video
And I come to rock the show
I'm just Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee

Ooh (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ooh (Dy-dy-dy, Dynamite)
At 13 I thought that I was in love with this guy
Anytime I caught his eye, I thought that I'd just die
Remember playin' class clown, I was a disruptive fool
And the beatin' that I got first time suspended from school
Remember Sunday School and after go to Gramma's for lunch
Macaroni, rice and peas, chicken and pineapple punch
Never had much, my mum, brother, sister and me
But love was enough to succeed
To grow

The shit that you promote
Fightin'
Fuckin'
Like you don't want to grow
You talkin' so much sex
But you nuh tell the yout's 'bout AIDS
And you nuh tell them all consequence, no
You talkin' like you a G
But you a
Killer killin' your own
You're just a racist man's pussy
Tell me who wants to know
What, when?
Who, where?
Or how you do your hoe?
Certainly not me
Certainly not me
'Cause baby personally
I like to be challenged mentally
I've heard it all before
Gangsters, pimps and whores
Quality is poor
A girl likes me needs more
It takes more (takes more)
To amuse a girl like me
So much more (so much more)
To confuse a girl like me
They got you (they got you)
'Cause while you're braggin' about your badness you're just
Avoidin'
Addin'
To the real shit that's happening to us
Now
Who gives a damn
About the ice on your hand?
If it's not too complex
Tell me how many Africans died
For the baguettes on your Rolex?
So what, you pushing a nice car?
Don't you know there is no such thing as superstars?
We leave this world alone
So who gives
A fuck
About the things you own?
Certainly not me
Certainly not me
'Cause baby personally
I like to be challenged mentally
Your bullshit's insignificant
And it don't help to pay my rent
It's pure negativity
That you impose on we
It takes more (takes more)

To the real shit that's happening to us
Now I can sit
And chat shit 'bout dicks and sex
But my business is my business I got self respect
I could talk 'bout how my press could pimp man's dough
Get the keys
To his ride
And his home
But I looked it up and that would make me a hoe
Little sisters now I really gotta let you know
Real women ain't sexy for no man's dough
Real women work hard to make their dough
And we can all chat 'bout gats and blacks on blacks, enforce the hypes and all be stereotypes we're used to watching
That ain't what I'm here for
Show 'em

36128,Ms. Dynamite,Brother,"When we were young
Life was so unjust
At times I felt it was just us
Mama working hard to put food on the table
All on her own she sacrificed
Even when my brothers and sisters died
Somehow she stayed strong
I never saw her cry
I was the oldest and responsibility was so immense
The tension, we'd disagree
So I left, at the time I felt she hated me
Told me to be strong
Told me to hang on, hugged me tight
And said, ""Big sister, it'll be alright""
Brother, I love ya
Little brother
I thank God for you every day
Little brother
I love ya
And I pray He'll never take you away
When my soul withered and I lived in the dark
An emptiness, it filled my heart
You never stopped holdin' me
Never stopped tryin' to open me up
The days and nights I spent stressin'
The years I spent in depression
This is my confession
Thought about ending it sometimes
But the second you crossed my mind
I knew I could never leave you
Made me believe
You set me free
To this day, all I say and do, I owe it all to you
Ooh
I would lie for you
Cry for you
Ride or die for you
Touch the sky for you
If you asked me to
There's nothin I won't do
I took this life for joke
I would drink or smoke

Treat your home like hotel and don't pay his way

At first glance, it's like cupid hit
Mesmerised by her thighs and her hips
So, she went ahead and find a man wit' some chips
She left school when she copped da whip
Caught in the game, locked in the speedin' lane
Live a life of money, drugs and fame
But true love is what she can't entertain
Now every chance she gets, she's given the blame
And then she's askin' why?
I told her, she was livin' a lie
When I told her, she started to cry
Don't just sit and let life pass you by
Then I slowly wiped the tear from her eye
And told her, take it slow
Girl, give it time to flow
And from a seed to a flower you'll grow
So many seeds on the street
No sunshine, but always heat
And lives are lost at every heartbeat
I told her, take it slow
Girl, give it time to flow
And from a seed to a flower you'll grow
So many seeds on the street
Drownin' in poverty and deceit
But black roses grow from concrete
He got a family to feed
So every night, he out on the street
Shottin' poison to young mothers and youths dem, 'cause he
Feel it's the only way he know to keep his peeps on they feet
Make ends meet and get his own up out of poverty
Until one night, he came home to find his mother cry
She pointed to the floor and saw a trail of his supply
She led him to his room to find his brother on his bed
Track marks, needles in his arm and stone-cold dead
And suddenly, they all flashed before his eyes
The kids that he sold to and they mother's cries
Every child is someone's child
You have to mind what you do
'Cause karma gonna bring the drama back on you
Do what you gotta do
But nigga when it comes to them youths
There is no excuse
Our future that, we supposed to nurture that

36135,Ms. Dynamite,Mr. Prime Minister,"1 ContributorMr. Prime Minister LyricsHow much hundred seats in parliament
Its so unfair but so clear
Don't none of them represent me
And ain't one of them represent my peers
And it don't matter who we vote for, nor who gets in
The poor keep dying and the rich keep living
Mothers keep losing their children to the system
They stay strong while we remain victims
Telling us to hope for higher things
Educate yourself ain't that how ya'll say it
But they keep increasing the fee
Knowing full well that we can't pay it
And did you stop and listen before you started dishing
Our tax for ammunition to kill innocent children
When right in front of you we can't cope
We hungry, homeless, unemployed and broke
Were dying, the health service is a joke
You said things would change when you wanted our votes
Chorus:
But it stays the same
Mr. Prime Minister
And we continue to die
Mr. Prime Minister
Not a damn thing changed
Mr. Prime Minister
Nobody hears our cries
When my life's a threat
They tell me run go call police
But yet who's gonna protect me from the beasts
They ain't got my interest at heart
They ain't my friends
Ain't got a enemy alive as evil as the system
So much corruption and this gun shit won't end
And all they sit and f***ing do is blame 50 Cent
Please, now take responsibility
Who's putting them runs on our streets
And who's pumping drugs into our community
Controlling the propaganda on my T.V
And who's molding our children's ideologies
And taking away their opportunity
Were killing each other so we can live above our means
Cause what we earn can't even buy a fraction of our dreams
And wonder why so many have become fiends
Its so hard to live poor and keep your hands clean
So I am keeping mind together
And pray that god forgives my sins
Its real hard living the life were living

You don't have to cry

As long as you keep holdin' on

You don't have to cry
’Cause the snitches running to the feds
Hoes bouncing from bed to bed
No place for trust in your head
Can't trust it...
Where so many tears are shed
Keep friends? He keep a 9 instead
He know tonight he could be dead
There's no justice...
So many troubled souls, so many broken homes
So many kids out of control
’Cause they hopeless...
Too many on parole, too many lies told
Too many had their freedom stolen
Tryin' to make it out the hood
Like, tryin' to make it out a manhole without a rope to pull
Hope the bullshit don't take me out for good
I know I gotta make the right example for my folk
I don't joke, though the smoke is hella hard to pull
I just take it to the chest like a vet
Gettin' still, what I feel on the inside is genocide
Tryin' to live on the outside, but will I die
But you tell me...
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry no more
As long as you keep holdin' on

Like they soldiers in Iraq
Every day them bodies drop
Keep droppin'...
Pain and violence round the clock
Need help but we can't trust the cops
So how the fuck we make it stop?
There's no stoppin'...
We tired of these bloody streets
All they breed is tragedy
This poverty so sad to see
So sad...
Long as them sirens ring
I pray to see the day you smile
Get up in my state, I'm tryin' to find fate
Gotta get it for grind's sake, I gotta find cake
Ain't no fire escape, I gotta climb gates
And knock down walls, and get up when I fall
You see, given the time I'll face, I can't slow the pace
Gotta move a little faster, ain't nobody on my side
I pray every night, feel like I ain't prayin' to God
Every time I tell Mom, she reply
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry no more
As long as you keep holdin' on
You can damn sure take it
We gon' make it, baby
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry no more
As long as you keep holdin' on
You can damn sure take it
We gon' make it, baby
You don't have to cry
Ain't a whole lot of love where we livin'
The self-hate replace the optimism
Ain't a whole lot of chances we're given
It's bullshit these streets is devil riddin'
Every day you hear another mother scream
Every night another victim, another murder scene
Every second another nigga turn fiend
But my ghetto children, hold on to your dreams
Though it's lookin' kinda rough, you gotta hold on
Though it's lookin' kinda rough, you gotta hold on
I know it lookin' kinda rough, you gotta hold on
Though it's lookin' kinda rough, you gotta hold on
Ay, ay, call me when it's, and call me when it's

It's dat bad black British bigger beats bitch
From Brixton to Beanu the streets get switched
She said hard lips ching, we don't want shit no
Singing a flow and it started a tempo
(Verse One)
Sharper dan a razor, when you walkin my way
Gonna fuck you up caught you up in the style
When I'm wise and my style, slit your wrist
Suicide, with my fists and my tounge comes like a knife
Meana-mee-za, meana-mee-za, and it's my trick
To six foot deeper dan da concrete
Comin' misty but like Shaggy ""It Wasn't Me""
It was my lyrical ability on Trinity
My flem caught on billy so my lyrics are a flame
So my tounge comes in danger signs of deadly
So dey sayin it's anotha explosion, but it won't really fussy, cuz I
Really 'em

Bring your dawgs, bring your men, bring your mum
Take her in like you fuckin wit sons
Cause I paid when the job is done

People dynamite's danger, the family changer
X-Zones banger, re-arranger, dynamite is danger
Now you don't know that dynamite's deadly, I'm ready
You ready, I'm ready, all's empty, dynamite is deadly

You so fun, bring your girly and cum
Dynamite is on, pussy ready on da run
Re-arrange your face like you was Jackson ta don

Power failure, let's get powerfully
Let's get one ting clear, MC wit'a pussy
But I'm not be fuck wit, I'm not to be dissed
Take another piece, just I'm just a lyricist

Man's say she's script and girl's sayin she's a bitch
MC's say she's shit cuz I'm here flippin scripts
People wit sense would say I don't wanna quick snitch
Labels wanna sign her, and raters like behind her
Haters wanna bind her and dawgs wanna grind her
Smart man stiff cuz dey ain't even fine
Cuz dey kno I ain't called Dynamite for nuttin

Everywhere I step, everywhere I turn

Everywhere I spin, everywhere I go

Got you pickin' up their weapons

Where you gonna run
Once he calls for you
Where you gonna hide
The day he sends for you
And he questions you
I wonder what you gonna say

When judgement day comes
I'm talking 'bout the sins you commit
Giving orders that permit
Killing innocent kids so you can fill your pockets

Now how you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
The pharmaceutical industry need to get paid
They're sitting on a cure
Watching newborn babies die of AIDS
Tell me, how you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
How could you keep exploiting third world children
Using them as underpaid slaves
So you can make your millions
How you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
We sit and watch while people get hurt
Stand to say nothing while they do the devil's work
Walk straight by leave them crying in the dirt
What kind of people does that make me n you?
And we could have all the good intent
But we sittin' in silence
And we committin' greed and violence
Then we got blood on our hands, too
When that judgement day comes and there's nowhere to run
Tell me, what is your plans?
’Cause all the wrong you've done
You know that you can't wash the blood from your hands
Before that judgement day comes
I pray that you learn to understand
And till my judgement day I pray
""Oh, Father, help me wash this blood from my hands""

36144,Ms. Dynamite,Father,"Father Lyrics
I spent 23 years trying to be what you wanted me to be
Though it seemed like you couldn't save me
'Til I picked up the mic and I was on the TV
Now you're ringing off my phone like every week
Where were you at 6, 7, 11 and 13
When shit was impossible
Mama left nine months pregnant
But she came home alone from the hospital
How could you call yourself a man
If you can't love your own unless you can control them
You'd rather destroy their souls, and she was 13 years old
And you could've protected the innocence from being stolen
And I don't give a damn what you was going through
When mama wasn't able to put food on the table
You left the family unstable
Now you come around acting like you want some kind of appraisal
You can't play like you daddy now
And you can't claim shit ’cause you weren't around
And you can get mad, but what can you do?
You can't tell me shit, I'm grown without you
I spent 23 years trying to be the fucking man you should be
Taking care of your responsibility
Putting clothes on our back and shoes on our feet, no help
But you always had your bag of weed
Where were you at 12, 13, 14 and 15
When life was unliveable
Momma was so damn angry
The way she treated me was unforgivable
You call yourself a man, your oldest son
He had to learn from his sister how to put a nigga's fist up
How to fuck a nigga's shit up and knock out any motherfucker
That had come and tried to diss us
And I don't give a damn what you was going through
When I needed saving, I spent my every second blazing
A little girl with a blade and trying to fuck up
And take my life, just wanted to dig my grave and
You can't play like you daddy now
And you can't claim shit ’cause you weren't around
And you can get mad but what can you do?
(Now what you gonna do?)
You can't tell me shit, I'm grown without you
You can't play like you daddy now
And you can't claim shit ’cause you weren't around
And you can get mad, but what can you do?
(You can't do a damn thing)

My heart just won't stop burning
But I gotta let it go
Fighting these feelings but they keep returning
I just gotta let it go, and
Mind, body and soul is yearning
I gotta let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go now...
I ain't timing a mutha****a
Boy you so damn sexy
But I know that we, can never be
The circumstances and consequence of us, pursuing and doing
This shit I been thinking about doing
Ain't gonna lead us to nowhere but ruin
I feel, I got too much to lose in you
A friend that I could see my side to ride
This the whole way through, oooh
And I really wish, I was the type of girl that ain't give a shit
Cause all I want to do is lose control
Touch your heart, and
Ease your soul
Repeat Chorus
How cupid gone just shoot me down
At a time like this
I fiend for just one kiss
Cause dreaming seems so hopeless
The circumstances and consequences of us fulfilling
These feels that I been feeling
Only gonna provide a s*xual healing
But I feel, there's so much more in our minds
Its like a spiritual higher level
Feel I known you my whole lifetime
And I really wish, I was the type of girl that ain't give a shit
Cause all I want to do, is loose control
And touch your heart, and
Ease your soul
Repeat Chorus
He takes my breathe away
And he knocks me off my feet
Got my heart skipping beats

Blushing every time that i caught his eye

36146,Ms. Dynamite,"Get Up, Stand Up","Get Up, Stand Up Lyrics
Get up stand up, make a difference
One shout is louder than a thousand whispers
Each breath brings death closer
What breath u got left, make the most of
Till your life is over
Sieze the time, life don't pause that record
No rewind, one time to hear that section
Hear opinions, but you've gotta rule in your kingdom
Make choices that cause you to realise your vision
You don't show it, but you can do it, blood i know it
Don't flow it but we still both thug poets
Raised by momma, nuff cut offs, gas and electrics
Certain birthdays I ain't get shit, but it's cool mums
Forget it, your love, the only reason that i ain't sleep
Only reason at these pricks I ain't poppin' off clips
Got family and friends that i'd lay down and die for
Forces in my head, but in my heart i'm still for the life force
Get up woah stand up
Stand up and make a change
Get up oh stand up now
Get up and make a change woah
However you hurtin', situation worsens by lack of earners
System only workin' for certain persons
A man 'll get caught tryna keep the rent up
But a paedophile 'll spend less time bent up
Next time you pick up, blood, think of the consequences
Someone's daughter or son cracked out on park benches
Can't do it I know, can't afford to have a soul
'Cause if you thinkin' you slippin' and not on ya toes
Genocide turned suicide, it's not coincidental
No chains, but it's worse when the shackles are mental
Scared to shine, don't share, breed like rabbits
Feed abuse of habits, and the situations get drastic
Kick in more, sure that it's soon to be you
We enterin, it's hard to be strong
When the lifestyles so temptin', fat pockets
Getting money, grabbin hoes away
But if we don't change today our kids grow the same way
Get up oh stand up
Stand up get up and fight
Get up oh stand up now
Don't just survive and live your life
However hard shit gets, try and maintain focus
'Cause god always side with the most hate and the brokest
I know there's a god 'cause all the times I should've died
Impossible circumstance, somehow I survived
Plus there's the fact that the universe is designed
Blood circulates, light reach Earth in the same time
Stars and cells born at rates you can't count
Body earth water solids exactly the same amount
Our everything, it's so insignificant
Earth not even cell-sized compared to total existence
Eighteen years ago, I weren't even visible
Now I spit lyrical syllables for spiritual criminals
Nothin' worse than potential that remained hidden
Don't look back could've, would've, should've, too late I didn't
While most of us struggle to strive for what we believe in
Imagine the strength of those who died for what they believe in
Get up, oh stand up
Stand up and make a change
Get up oh stand up now
Get up and make a change woah
Get up oh stand up now
Don't just survive

1 ContributorFall in Love Again LyricsI never wanted to fall in love
He took me from where I was comfortable
Skeptical still I gave my all
But he couldn't handle it
He was too insecure and immature
I was open, my heart got broken
I shoulda' known that it was gonna be this way
I let him in, now I'm burnin'
I wish that we never even met that day
Now let me tell you how the story goes
Sure you heard it all a million times before
I loved and lost and now I'm in pain
I ain't never gonna give my heart to love again
Chorus:
When I fall in love
It will be forever
Coz I'll never ever
Fall in love again
When I fall in love
There will be no other
Only me and you
In this whole wide world
A lover that can sweet me, keep me on my toes
A brother that can keep me from the cold
Elevate my mind and stimulate my soul
Love me much and he ain't afraid to let it show
And help me grow and he's honest
And a promise is a promise
I can trust him completely, coz he keep his word
Help me achieve things there every time I need him
And he sacrifice, he always put me first
Now let me tell you exactly what I want
I know you heard it all a million times before
Strong enough that he ain't causing me pain
But that's what its gon' be if I ever fall in love again
Repeat Chorus
Me nah really care
For the way certain boy dem a flex
The way dem bwoy 'a gwan jus'a get me vex
The attitude, disrespect
The games and the strain
Got a good woman like me, never wanting to know love again
Coz love has been pain, I'm at the end of my tether
So if I fall in love again, its gotta be for ever
I know you heard it all a million times before
I ain't the first and sure as hell gonna be many more

Allowing you to pollute my space with
Ya bullshit
You been doing me wrong, I been
Unhappy with this relationshit
Putting up with it
For way to long
I been, stooping to your level
Playing games
Going out my way to disrespect you
Though I accept that you can't do me nothing
That I ain't let you do... hmmmmmmm
I been repeating myself, its frustrating
All this confrontation is stagnating
And animosities all I'm accumulating
You say you gonna change
Well I'm done waiting baby
Chorus:
I gotta get away cause I need to heal
Can't take another day of how you make you feel
Gotta get away so I can break the chain
You causing all this pain but imma take the blame
Cause you don't understand what your doing
And it's like there so urgency to change
I remember days that you consoled me
Now I see that only I can lift my pain
You think cause you ain't beating me or cheating on me
The way you mistreating me ain't abuse
But if you loved me
You wouldn't want me here with you
And you know that its true
You got me standing in the mirror asking a woman
I don't know, why the f**k she stuck around
Cause I been living with a stranger
That gets off on putting and keeping and seeing me down
I ain't seen that man I feel in love with in so long
Did he exist, was I fooled?
Cause he was so beautiful and you are so... cruel

Ohhh, let it go, let it go, let it gooo hmmmm

For some ignorant, wannabe bad, dumb mutha****a
To just come and shoot up the place

With all these bit**es that just came to fight
I'm with my girls and my niggas
So take your hand up off that trigger
And just ease up your vibe tonight

Put yo gun away G
Release the stress and just chill
Put yo gun away B
Ya dressed too damn good to kill
Put yo gun away pleeease
Oohh, I don't wanna leave till 6 in the morning
Put yo gun away
At least till the break of dawn
See I been working hard all week long
I just came to release the strain
Of the bullshit that we taking on
Husting and grinding every day
I don't wanna drink and I don't need no drugs
Gimme that bassline that's my high
Brotha' stop your negativity
Cause now your f***in with my vibe

See I just really wanna get my party on and chill with my friends
And I just wanna hear the DJ play my songs until 6 AM
And I just wanna see the people up in here have yourself a good time

Slide, Slide, Slide
Every time I'm in the club the pricks are exciting
Puling up gangstas and car bidders
Its not gangsta to start violence
Give it a break, every concert it happens again
Come on, cuss cuss, use your brain
You got beef leave it on the road
Better still leave your gun at home
And just have a laugh
Buy a bottle find a girl on fera glass
You might have some fun
She might wanna dance
I'm about sipping don tell I'm very drunk
You know why she's about that bubbles bust
No beef flying up, let the poe burn
Now looking in my face you don't know me cause
Little Sim says used need a hug
Scared of the real world so you need a gun
Putting tears in the eyes of another mum
Calm down be easy, it ain't hard fam

And the beating that I got first time suspended from school
Remember Sunday school an after go to Grandma's for lunch

Just not today
Please not today
I don't really got time to stop and talk
But don't take it personal
I been up all night with my son
I'm tryna reach the doc before he close
I'm stressed out, upset, the lack of sleep got me emotional
And it's that time of the month
Just to really fuckin' piss me off
I'm feelin' self-conscious
Just need me a little space
So Mr. Media, ya betta take ya camera out my face
Not today, I got things on my mind
Not today, now ain't that the place or time
Not today, I'll do it all any other day
Just not today, please not today
I don't mind signing an autograph
But you the 99th person to ask
And all I really wanna do is break down and cry
'Cause a close family friend just passed
I know you already booked the studio
But at the mo' my head can't cope
I'm aware that I made a commitment
But I never knew my heart would be broke
I'm dealing with some issues
Believe me I don't mean to be rude
Only human, forgive me, if you sense a little attitude
Not today, I got things on my mind
Not today, now ain't that the place or time
Not today, I'll do it all any other day
Just not today, please not today
Now let me get one thing clear
I know it's y'all that keep my here
And I'm grateful like you could never know
More thankful than I could ever show
But if, you could sympathize from just a second
I reckon you could understand where I'm coming from
Sometimes when I'm steppin' out my house
I ain't steppin' out as Dynamite
I'm stepping out as Mum
Tryna spend some quality time with my son. Whew!
If you could understand
This weren't the way I planned, its gotten out of hand
Sometimes I feel I don't even know when I am
Since I picked up the mic, my private life don't exist
Love my job, but I never know I was signing up for this
Dealing with makeups and breakups, gotta smile and be strong
Clearing with heartache and heartbreak, but the show must go on
Not today, I got things on my mind
Not today, now ain't that the place or time
Not today, I'll do it all any other day

Apology
Black people, we our own worst enemy
Jealousy, envy, so many frenamies
Still got that house-nigga, field-nigga mentality
We don't wanna see us rise to the top
Smiling when we see a brother striving, then he drops
Instead of helping him to succeed, get all that he can get
We hating, contemplating, taking his jewels and his whip
Shit you there paper-chasing, thinking it'll end your stress
Can't buy self esteem, love not selflessness
You can drive a million miles, in your Bentley like a star
You can fly across the globe, but can't escape who you are
And all this bragging and this boasting about the paper that you stack
Can't achieve as a people unless back give back
Think it ain't your problem turn your back you hypocrite
As long as poverty exists there'll be robbery of the rich
Shit now listen...
Chorus:
This negativity got me ready to explode
Its like were on animosity overload
Were hustling the same hustle, down the same road
But were on self-destructive mode
Until we have unity we can't grow
If we could let go and let the love flow
We struggling the same struggle, down the same road
But were on self-destructive mode
Assasin's Verse:
We still living in division applied when we were slaves
Our ancestors are probably turning in their graves
To see a brother, see another and just shoot him down
Never did him no wrong he just form the other side of town
And its foolish and senseless, I can't comprehend
Sisters when we see our sisters why we face just a bend
And we don't show love
We don't pay no compliments
We show hostility and cause enough commotion
Shit now listen...
Repeat Chorus
Assasin's Verse:
We ain't fighting racism
Or the injustice were shown
We fighting in our homes
And busy destroying our own
Complaining about the white man
And the way he make us live
But plenty of us, in the street, selling crack to our kids
And its so crazy and its ridiculous
Take a look at what were doing
Ignorance ain't bliss
Were so played by fear and insecurity
That we destroying and exploiting our community

1 ContributorBack Then Lyrics
Never forgot the day he came my way
From the very first second he stole my heart
Tired to play hard to get
But I was hooked from the start
Acting grown, the things he'd say
When we were hand in hand walking in the park
My first kiss, first crush, first Valentine card
So infatuated, so uncomplicated
Back then
When love was just a smile
Memories though a window
What I wouldn't give to go
Back then
When love was just a smile
Back in the day when love was so sweet
Funny how simple things used to be
Reminiscing on you and me
Take me back to my memories
Back in the day when love was so sweet
Funny how simple things used to be
Reminiscing on you and me
Take me back to my memories
He'd walk me home most days of the week
Hiding down the street so my mother couldn't see him
She woulda give us a hell of a beating
I remember, kiss chasing, heart racing
So weak when you'd look
Writing your name on my school books
Nervous, shy and shaking
Constant feelings racing
Back then
I still hear my trembling voice
Floating through the echoes
When I wouldn't give to go
Back then
When love was just a smile

Then I won’t even be salty just hope you don’t pay the bitch
So don’t even complain and shit when I’m banging away at him
Cause he really loving Psalm and she never been gay and
But I’m just playing til you hop up off that airplane
Cause when you outta town I know them groupies fair game
And when i’m outta town I hook up for sure
That’s why they really need to go on and book us a tour
Those crackhead bitches wishing they had crack
Trying to burn me like Abednego and Shadrack
When I pull my Jimmy out girl it ain't nothing to laugh at
Sisters always be like, Rugged Man is you half-Black
Ooh baby yours is like the feet that Shaq has
And mine is like the complete opposite of a wack vag
So you know we happily strap that
Cause I don’t know the way to the nearest crab shack
And I roam today but you know that I’m right back
Cause can’t nobody do me like a Rugged Man, you the fucking man

When I wake up in the AM, I'm thankful and committed
This crystal life is fitted
Trying to get that buzz and snap back
All this education, get all these folks to back that
Front me all you want to, but I got these bangin' smoothies
Lemonhead don't suit you, your bitterness don't change shit
Pain is proven, pleasure principles and petty anguish
Missed me with that super-hater, I just came the same bitch
Keeping on my schedule, I know my finesse, mane
Got my CD cliqued up, trying to rumble for some web fame
Market and promotion, what happened to your fresh tape?
Oh. You looked good though
Better get those checks while you can
By popular demand
You just have to understand
That you stepping in the Land of the Windy's illest
And you just don't stand up to greatness
In the stands, as a champion demands of my city limit
Ha, my city limits get a bad rap with all this 
Everybody pointing fingers, everybody is the problem
You in the basement, taking shit away from talent
Shit, it took me nine years just to link with Panik
That whole look-stupid sorry moment, I promise I will never postpone moments
Cause it's golden, impossible to hold on and focus
When you too busy rolling on that whole shit
And you'll notice that it's hopeless
CHORUS:
Auntie was a player and my uncle was a preacher
Sipping on a bottle about the size of your ego
Used to rep the choir and my range was alto
Now I'm like the flyest in my lane from Chicago
And I don't ride big, but I got the money for the ticket on the rims
Feeding all my friends while you feasting on a trend
Queen til the world ends (queen til the world ends)
Alright (x6)
Queen til the world ends (queen til the world ends)
Alright (x6)
Queen til the world ends (queen til the world ends)
Wicker Park to Pilsen, Evanston to Englewood
Hunter's to the Low End, Hyde Park to your hood
Peace to all the peaceful, ""fall back"" to the violent
Middle fingers blazing to the fakers keeping silent
Derrick Rose got money, Kanye and Obama too
What you doing rocking that when they shut off your water, fool?
I don't go  my flush, it is affordable
Anyone who's shucking when you're jiving is recordable
Know these villains laughing, and your children bastards
I go and teach them so they won't go out so tragic
They won't play the jam on GCI cause it ain't trendy
But I just cashed another check, guess the truth is plenty
In me is a fire, and a message to inspire
Fuck with me, I guarantee, you'll listen to the right stuff
Your favorite rapper be looking to me for therapy
So stop comparing me to bitches I don't care to be
Auntie was a player and my uncle was a preacher
Sipping on a bottle about the size of your ego

So I'm fixing that more and more and more
Daddy pimp a girl, I can't be a whore
So you know I’m fixing that more and more and more
Ex said I'm an angel, I'm a monster
And that hater hate me more and more and more
I don't know how to really act
But you know my next showing will be better than my last
Climb up the stairs, step up to the plate
Pocket full of tens, canvas full of grey
Girl my back hurts now how much do I owe you
I’m guaranteed to grow soon
Luggage in the corner, portable me
Sub-ject sus-pect, the chorus agrees
Something like a road cat, something like a flea
In the ear of the big dog, at times I’m a bit large
Year of the frequent flyer, year of the screwy
Ran away so fast I swear I never knew me
Didn’t look back, just getting to that
Moved six times in three years, fool
You unpack
I gotta lot going on, a great idea can be a boring song
So I wake up from near death most nights
In a rush cause I’m worried about my near life
You hear me right
I’m cuddling my crazy
It’s hard to trust me but I cook amazing gravy
Tastes good on anything you willing to bang out
You can have it later when your fav-o-rites flame out
Hey, what you talking bout
Another rapper found dead
I guess brother's don’t mind trading lead for lead
I know why you chose rap, get out from the struggle
Not knowing what they say that nigga in the club do
So pardon moi for the flossing
When I get off the road I toss dollars to the wind
But I couldn’t see myself dying for the cause
Cause a lotta lines that I tend to rhyme get lost
Or is that a shame
Or is that the game
Oh, that’s the same thang
Y'all be changing, trying to change what
They coming for your shit and they aiming for your gut
I warm up tummies, my product stay love
You scorn-fucked dummies should get your hate up
Or ya ni-cest spi-ces, get your plates up
Cause I’m better than anything you have a taste fa
Step one, gotta get yourself spun
Nobody gonna know you better than you hun
Step two, you gonna need better shoes
I know it's stupid but those are the rules
Step three, decoding your pedigree
Just know what you're facing in your worst enemy, then we go to
Step four, you ain't heard this before

I've been an original since birth, ask my mother
There are so many individuals in this shit
But too many people who don't really share the vision
Isn't it ironic that it's raining on your wedding day
Does it really mean that you should call it your beheading day
Now is that really fair, now tell me is it true
That when you please everyone, you really pleasing you
I see that you confused, what she trying to birth
I'm about my paper caper, I'm putting in work
I am bout my biz bro, I don't have time for stalling
The only type of Stalin I knew, I studied in college
Majored in the sciences but minored in rhetoric
I can break you down and spit it hotter than Devilish
I don't care about the way you do this, you were clowning
I know all about your little movement, bowel
I don't give a fuck about it
I just want my cut up out it
You can't get around it
I just spent a couple thousand on my Ginsu knives
And I'm taking out my portion, with my Ginsu knives
And then I spread endorphins
Yo these are the list of dudes for sure
Came through the door, using so
Chopping door, stop the flow
You throw up all on your clothes
Switch that shit with H20
Making dough, you can't take the toll
These are unbreakable ain't no more after me and
Apathy, and that's the only thing you grasping, see
Has to be and that's because you trying to take a crap on me
Serve this, whirling, dervish record this
Full force sitting, paring like a swordfish
Pop out your organs, swashbuckling touching ya
Like the muss with tear, corruption, fear
Weird Science, clear and vibrant
I'm sharper than a blade in the hands of Blue Beard the Pirate
Who I got to punish now
Funny acting, funny style
Major send-off, they will send you to they Auntie house
When you wanted them, when you wanted him
Why you wanna go there baby you can have a song
And we can have it all, beauty with some good brain
Intelligent, multicultural with a hood swing
You can go with that one though
She had a fat butt but guess what
She bulimic, it's gone catch up, man up
I'm a lady with a goal
Freezer so cold, you can bake em in the snow
No I ain't that hussy you can fuck and then quit
If you fuck me you will definitely never wanna split

Next time I come outside I'm gonna get it
Come back with a hundred stacks, dead Presidents
Mission accomplished, later for that nonsense
Free from negativity, I leave undaunted

Fuck you and whoever sent - you!

36171,Psalm One,48 Bars,"I never been one for storming in them poker rooms
Tell you the truth
I'm still fucking with them focus groups
I spent a birthday afternoon at one, you think it's funny
Checking my traps, getting my scratch I used it for bar money
Was crying on the BART in San Francisco once
Had to do it in public cause all of my friends were dunce
Capping my feelings, popping them beans showing that I could stand it
Running from what, strong as a fuck I know that man planned it
Got signed and I just hopped a van before I knew it
I'd do it again in a heartbeat, cause I was called to do this
Blessed to be around a team letting me figure my angles
Y'all killing ya'll selves for a label to label, you
While I'm signing for another package
Another rapper called and I don't wanna help him manage
That sucks cause it's a Boss lady civic duty but
I'm filming documentaries they shooting kid's movies
I really do love y'all, I'm just busy
I just haven't been through, enough cities
You may think that me and you travel same
But I'm working on my wings while you Tweeting on the plane
You a lame and I'm lamer cause I don't go to Lumen
But I just illuminated five hundred students
More like a thousand when I'm counting those logged in
You got a shelf life and to a shelf that's a problem
Popular, no but I won't stop popping up
Growing so much they re-calculate my commas what
Don’t tear you down build you up so I'm building that
Turning blind ears to your party party trendy rap
Bend it back break it down tear me off a piece of that
Featuring the fearless, intelligent chic black
Bumping Cap looking at cap and gown
Touching rap, you got a deal but what happens now
Selling several thousand ain't the outlet that it once was
So you kidding, I keep coming with that funk, cuz
Boosting my numbers putting folks up on Psalm shit
They radar doing that
I don't care to be on it
Calling my mama and venting, I'm simply addicted to being a factor
After the rain and the sun and the rain
I'm beginning to see just what that does
Betting it all on the fact that I'm Psalm
And I know that I'm needed in rap cause
The people are sleepy and bored with your horrible lies and your terrible act, what
Cristalle take the prism and the colors keep the light around
Blues and reds and greens and I'm just talking bout the high I'm on
Kept in isolation but I'm fighting through and shining strong
Show you how to live a life and do it through this microphone
Kids be getting made just to listen how I do
So if you think that ain't the truth, you just ain't in the loop
Picking up philanthropy to help repair the damage

1 ContributorA Girl Named You Lyrics
Wait a minute (Wait a minute)
Wait a minute (Wait a minute)
I'ma bring you home (huh)
Wait a minute (Wait a minute)
Wait a minute (Wait a minute)
Wait a minute (Wait a minute)
I'ma bring it all home (uh)
Wait a minute (Wait a minute)
Wait a minute (Wait a minute)
Wait a minute (Wait a minute)
I'ma bring you home (Wait a- uh)
Wait a minute (Wait a minute)
Wait a minute (Just wait a minute)
Wait a minute (Wait a minute)
I'ma bring it all home
When I was just about 10 years old
I walked up to the prospect of a cleaner soul and I
Clung tight to the preacher's robe
Brought down to the pulpit with my meek exposed
He was my uncle
And it was like the first Sunday
Of the month
I really had a thirst to pray
What a stunt
My momma just cried and cried
Filled up her loving chest with pride and I
Unbuckled
I gave it all to Him full of sin with a grin in my childish ways
I chuckled
Paved the way for grimacing when I couldn't sit with my bible way
Wait a minute I
Forgive me father
I've altered from the true callin' of a good Christian
I sin and I don't bother
To go to church
Don't sweat the meanings
But I know you gotta know I holla', check for Jesus
Back then
I spent every Sunday
Trapped on God's runway
Prayin' for Monday baby
Back then
I wore all those dresses
Dealt with the stresses
Of being so fresh it's crazy
I don't know how it all went down
But those church kids like to clown
Believe me
We would sneak up the street
Doing speeches by the preacher
Just a peek-a-boo sneakers crew
You heard me
I'm sorry
I'm sorry for the sorry
I'm sorry for the parties
I'm sorry for the sloppy start you got my heart
I'm sorry for the lottery, the robbery, the mockery
Stop me please
And I know he's sayin'
What's up with a girl named you
What's up with a girl named you
And I know he's sayin'
What's up with a girl named you
What's up with a girl named you
And I know he's sayin'
What's up with a girl named you
What's up with a girl named you
And I know he's sayin'
What's up with a girl named you
What's up with a girl named you
First there was two sets of footprints in the sand
Then there was one set of footprints in the sand
Then there was traces of my hand in his hand
Suddenly it all faded away
First there was two sets of footprints in the sand
Then there was one set of footprints in the sand
Then there was traces of my hand in his hand
Suddenly it all faded away
So I struggle with the prospect of Hell
The object of failin' the man upstairs
And I know I'm human
He knows I'm human
But every now and then I'm too tough to care
But my auntie prayed
That I would never stray
And I would feel guilt every time I did
So once in a while
I smile at the child
And cry for the woman who lies and fears
And I know she's sayin'
What's up with a girl named you
What's up with a girl named you
And I know he's sayin'
What's up with a girl named you
What's up with a girl named you
And I know he's sayin'
What's up with a girl named you
What's up with a girl named you
And I know he's sayin'

Tryin' to work in my city like pullin' teeth
So you won't see me lurkin' in your ""cool scenes""

Spillin all over my kicks, they ain't Louis V

I see smart silly people chase stupid dreams
Swimmin in a pool of debt, willy talk is cheap
I put my money where my mouth is and press some shirts
Hop a bird, Flip a show joe, and get to work

36188,Invincible,Sledgehammer!,"Detroit’s white rapper of note (what, you know of any others?) spits serious lyrics while shouting out her musical and political heroes
Listen
I got a passion for spitting
Smashing the competition
Vocals the logo for the back-to-back world champion Pistons
Undebatable
Flesh is biodegradable
People ego deflatable
See no evil and play the role?
I'm Peter Gabriel
With a sledgehammer
Red handed
Bled stanzas
Set standards
Dedicated to Dilla, Proof, Abel Meeropol, Fannie Lou Hamer, Marlon Riggs
Nina, and Fred Hampton
There goes the neighborhood like
Fred Sanford next door to Ned Flanders
These cats pop off at the mouth like Orville Redenbacher
My lyrics open up the portal to your seven chakras
Helicopters circling
Watch the exchange of Betty Crocker
Soap operas inventing drama
Prevent it
Remember Nakba
SMASH various barriers
Bury us under road blocks
You don't get it. Get it yet? Do you?
The struggle don't stop
It don't quit
Worldwide winning with style like Globetrotters
Don't try this at home
If you stuck in time with broke watches
SMASH the walls of hate
End it for the next descendants
Watching em fall from grace
Repping for the independents
Futuristic sound
You just missed it now
Present with the essence
To evolve, put it all at stake
(You don't pay attention man)
That's why your power is the size of your attention span
Dilla said it best: (You don't pay attention man)
That's why your respect's the size of your attention span
Its fresh air when I'm speaking to y'all
Sometimes it falls upon deaf ears like I'm speaking to walls
I ain't preaching to y'all
Breaking cycles of violence
Not repeating they flaws
Open up your memory bank
I got the key to the vault
Serving the antidote to Alzheimer's
Delete and install
Ginkgo biloba  think it over
We the leaders we've all been waiting for
Believe it
Heed the call
Breathe it
Keeping involved
These lyrics heat seekers
Deplete tweeters til the speakers dissolve

Or making millions of papers
Our blood is spilling

Prepare for take off
Touch down Ben-Gurion
Strict search make sure nobody enters with bombs
Blue white flags
For the Birthright Tour I’m on
Never mention three villages the airport is on
Recent history buried
But it speaks through the sand
All Jews: Law of Return
I don’t seem to understand
""A land without a people for people without a land""?
But I see a man standing with a key and a deed in his hand
First stop: museum of the Holocaust
Walking outside–in the distance–saw a ghost throwing a Molotov
Houses burnt with kerosene
Mass graves
Couldn’t bear the scene
It wasn’t a pogrom–it was the ruins of Deir Yassin
Next stop: shopping at the Kenyon Malcha
Built it on the back of the town Al-Malha
Wishing we could call it its name;
Appalled by the change;
And now a mall full of chains
Is all that remains.
My Ima misses people not places
Has she seen the towns with names in Arabic the Hebrew replaces?
The policies are evil and racist, deceitful and heinous
You’ll never be a peaceful state with legal displacement
Remember the names of our cities before you came and replaced it
Remember and tell me how am I supposed not to miss a nation living within us?
At the Wailing Wall I’m rolling a wish
Then stick it in between the hole in the bricks
I’m feeling more than melancholy
This used to be the Moroccan quarter
Until we stopped em short and
Now their grandkids is the ones that’s throwing rocks at borders
I ain't one to play and I don’t pray often
So I’m AWOL'n
While you making native sons
Feel like a stranger in they own land like James Baldwin
This ain't about a Qur'an or a synagogue or Mosque or Torah
The colonizer break it into acres and dunums
Erasing the culture
Changed Haifa to Chaifa
Changed Yaffa to Yaffo
The old city left to haunt
Hummus pronounced chumoos, we ate in a restaurant
Next hit the discotheque
Yes we on the list of guests
Palestinians can't get in
Its blatant disrespect
Cops stop em for speaking they language
Its dangerous
To repeat it when
With history we disconnect
200 year old olive trees
Uprooted the groves
To build a wall
Now their future enclosed
Settlements spreading like cancer and toxic sewage polluted the roads
Now full of checkpoints
I superimpose the truth and it shows
Village ruins overgrown with planted trees
Who’d have thought the ""desert blooms"" and Tu Bishvat
I can't believe
This ain't environmental
Disguising lies, extincting lives like manatees
Calling it a transfer? Please–
More like a catastrophe!
Birthright tours recruiting em, confuse em into moving in
Claim its only names and words but denying the root of them
Power been abusing it
Our past never excusing them
60 years since 48 and 40 since Jerusalem
My boy Shadi wanted to visit it so badly
He lied he’s diabetic to see it for five seconds
One Nine Four ruled the courts in the case

Summer in the city, wonder how we made it through the winter
So hot and humid, but the music gets me through it, feeling good
Look forward to this way of life, we represent the future
You only see the bad, yeah shit is real, but we still feeling good
I woke up to buildings in flames, am I still in my dream?
Rub my eyes, see the reflection off the windows, just a lovely sunrise
The brightest fuchsia rays, here to light the future day
On my way to the Isle, playing Nina on the radio dial
I stay for a while –
I daydream, blaze sinsemilla, about to meet with Shea at the Marina
Around the corner from the Roostertail, thinking 'bout the schools and jails
Put our youth for sale, that's why we fighting tooth and nail
We refuse to fail, 'til justice and truth prevail
Set sail, elders tell us about the rum-runners, thinking of booze and ale
Underground Railroad – last stop, Detroit River
Escaping to freedom, had to swim across the Windsor
Can you feel the ancestors in these currents?
To swim upstream it takes vision and endurance
Look at the horizon, sun reflecting off the water's surface
Detroit is better made, dog, so I'm sipping on some Vernors
Summer in the city, wonder how we made it through the winter
So hot and humid, but the music gets me through it, feeling good
Look forward to this way of life, we represent the future
You only see the bad, yeah shit is real, but we still feeling good
Detroit in the summer, it's more than a season
When I moved to the city, was the core of the reason
Can I clarify all the distortion you seeing?
Gotta break your mind out of prison while the warden is sleeping
Politicians make a fortune by thieving
The air quality since the Model T could shorten your breathing
Follow me to a city where empty lots turn to garden plots
Got alternatives in place, so we could disregard the cops
It's still a seedling, but the future The D brings –
Getting to the root while you still cutting off the tree limbs
Strengthening the weak links, brown fields from rotting tires
Sunflowers reaching high to detoxify The D
Everybody rocks a fitted, but don't watch the Tigers
A block party uniting, sparks where the shots are fired
It's hot, cool it off by opening the hydrants
Call Motown a ghost town, but the city's vibrant
Summer in the city, wonder how we made it through the winter
So hot and humid, but the music gets me through it, feeling good
Look forward to this way of life, we represent the future
You only see the bad, yeah shit is real, but we still feeling good
Detroit's alive and well, don't need no more requiems
Elected officials, they greed has infected 'em
Sell the residents out, then they leave and neglected 'em
Guess they couldn't see that now The D is the next to win
Not as in some self-appointed demagogues developing these
Overpriced and empty dark casinos where old ladies play the penny slots
Trying to pay they rental costs
Living on a shoestring or some dental floss
Here's the real renaissance
Go from post-industrial to the most illustrious
Anyone who wants a change, you better know it's up to us
Start working together, no more crabs in a barrel
When did freedom ever come about from asking a Pharaoh?
That's rhetorical –
Why wait for opportunity to knock when you could build a door or two?
Self-reliance out of crisis, that's what we transforming through
We the oracle – like summertime, Detroit is what the world has to look forward to
Summer in the city, wonder how we made it through the winter
So hot and humid, but the music gets me through it, feeling good

36191,Invincible,Deuce/Ypsi,"A devastating critique of the false progressivism of “liberal” towns.  A sort of modern-day update of Phil Ochs' classic “Love Me, I’m a Liberal”
White picket fences, green lawns, nice, rich, expensive
College campus, so progressive
Every child advances
Lies and deception
Difference is tolerated
With a few exceptions
So liberal and colorblind you hear a ""beep"" when you cross the street
Let the bubble pop from culture shock and the cost of deceit
Off the beaten path
Reaching in my past
How'd I get involved?
Trying to keep the Klan from speaking on the roof of city hall
But analyze oppression on the daily
The truth of the deuce, city that raised me and failed me
Even worse than the Klan, still asking
Why across the street from Braeburn and Forest Hills is where they built the landfill?
Colorful like mill creek
Most of us we grew apart but some of us we still speak
Introduction to America, Bryant Elementary
Childhood friends from Stonybrook now in the penitentiary
It ain't coincidentally
Tracked before middle school as criminals
By teachers who belittled you, claiming they're ""liberal""
By 14 most of my feminine friends raped
Many males expelled to Stone or Clemente
Detroit was another planet–broken and abandoned
We so blinded, close minded, hoping to expand it
What part of Ann Arbor is this?
What part of Ace Deuce is this?
What part of Ann Arbor is this?
What part of Ace Deuce is this?
They say, ""You from Ann Arbor, right?
""Oh, you had it good!""
Don't get me wrong, these ain't your worse-than-average hoods
But there's people struggling here
My family included
Don't let the campus fool you
It's a whole different planet for students
Blacks we outnumbered
Only a handful of us
But poverty's real for most of these fams growing up
Poverty varies
I'm sure it's worse in other places
What makes it bad is
They dangle work in front of our faces
Like there's opportunities with the U and Google here
But it's a glass ceiling
Like snow globes for souvenirs
Go in the south side
You really see the patterns of races;
Ypsilanti might as well be an African nation
Second class citizens
Second class living conditions
Second class schools
Are for second-class kids to just skip in
Back in the Deuce
Some of the best public schools
But so many of my homies still chose the hustler root
Why?
And got the nerve to wanna beef and act foolishly
Knowing our separation
Is only about 2 degrees
Something ain't right
Something ain't adding up
We gotta stick together cause
We got it bad enough
What part of Ypsi is that?
What part of Ypsilanti is that?
What part of Ypsi is that?
What part of Ypsilanti is that?
Broken glass
Shitty pampers
Dirty needles
Nobody passes
All fear
We see the evil
Public education
Who the fuck gon' make it
Ain't nothing change
It's the same situation
Generation drug dealers
Tell me where that leave us?
Is it just me cause everybody smoking reefer?
We take pride when we say we from the south side
But that's small thinking
I'm trying to reach worldwide
Different standards
But everybody's got the answer
Making that Michigan's white chocolate is dancer ???
The spot got hot from breaking bullets down to rock
Crooked cops taking money from your socks
Home sweet home
Where it's impossible to beat the game
Niggas sold they soul
And told 'em, ""Keep the change.""
Are we to blame?
Cause around here
It's, ""Fuck them niggas!""
Like Bush when Katrina came
Prime made the south make when they keep the thing
Wealth made the niggas grind in the freezing rain
That's the west side
Trust me, the east the same
Stonybrook boys heavy like keys o' cane
Believe it, man, this is hell, y'all
It ain't college dreamland, like they tell ya'
South side, Y-town, where the shells fall
Niggas keep answering when the jails call
But I rep my city, what I'mma switch fo'?
I mean, Detroit listens, but it's the crib, though
It's all fucked up, as far as the shit go
But if you ain't living for change
Then what's to live for?
What part of Ann Arbor is this?
What part of Ace Deuce is this?

And his feet are aching

To prepare for the events about to take place
Invading with a treatment and aiming at point blank range
Injected by a form undetected to the forces
Who are hoarding resources to make a quarter

Reconnect the cord from the brain to the aorta

That all the power's within 'em to counteract this

Schools closing
Breakin' in to pop the lock
Cops mace babies–Krylon their eye sockets slots
Getaway high speed chase youth lead the way
Round up the dj's only down to three days
And survival hinges on the motto that the knowledge is within us

Condos remodel my old turf
For what it's worth, soul got left in the earth
On a search I stood in front of Compuware
The Hudson Building spoke first and said I was here
From old bricks all over downtown
To Sears with the Roebuck attachment
Purple Gang used to move through your block
Like a Mafia pageant
Move around in my town
Where spittas talk
And if you leave, forget us
And try to come back?
I hope you turn into a pillar of salt
Every jackhammer cracking the concrete
That's a lost and forgotten piece of the D
We’ll never see in a book or paper
Replaced with a temp casino
Strip mall, liquor store
Another stadium doubling as a palladium, eateries
The D speaks to me
Now watch yesterday get swept away beneath a pile of debris
Committees picking from a lottery
For the hottest riverfront property
Sign over your deed
Shocking to see us go from Peoplemover to people movers
Let the people choose a better way
They set up shop and sped away
Landmarks come and go like a john with a pro
Led astray and they run up on Detroit for consumption
So I look back and see my city
Under construction
Look back and see my city
Under construction
By the locusts
Surrounding suffocating the city and trying to choke us
Ravaging the crops making the situation hopeless
But we staying focused
Never let the locusts approach us
Locusts and buzzards circle and hover above the
Abandoned houses shattered windows with the crooked shutters
Cross the street construct a cookie cutter condominium
Lining Woodward, it's the prime meridian
You divide the city and
In the hood, wonder why you pay two times the premiums?
They been redlining the dark-skinned
Owners of homes where they loan with a sharks fin
Arson the property probably for the insurance policy
It's a prophecy that's self fulfilling
They claim to cure us of poverty, BUT
It's serving removal
Of residents with urban renewal
The reverend is the realtor
Here to save and heal ya!
They even “buy ugly houses”
And its memorabilia
Of a myth of a city that's a mystery
Auto industry’s widow
On the auction floor they start to bid low
On houses with hanging gutters and peeling shingles
Purchased at a nervous pace and a cadence
I heard a wrecking ball hit a building that's mistaken for vacant
A sleeping city awakened
By bulldozers and the wool pulled over our eyes
It comes as no surprise
Why the rents are more from the French to Ford
To the Ilitches
Trying to pillage the village and milk it for all that it's worth
While they killing us
But we still got resilience
Selective memory, convenient amnesia
Enemies scheming on land seizures
Pretend to be well meaning but stampede us
I know you not supposed to bite the hand that feeds ya
But it's poisonous, spread injustice like fungus candida
Predatory planning
Eminent domain
Mowed down Motown
For parking lot next to the game
Empty sentiment of development for pennies to gain
Forget memory lane
This is history
It's like erasing Proof–only remembering Eminem’s name
Many stories
Only one written in pen will remain
With jobs – we at least in a drought
Met a construction worker hates demolishing buildings
But gotta feed his seeds and his spouse
Told me the city pushes people into leaving they house
They cut the lights and gas it freezes em out
Who decided the divide between suburb and ghetto corner?
Henry Ford swinging his chain, the Nazi medal of honor
I'm looking at this strip
Where Lottie the body she probably shook them hips
The malnourished and wild flourish
Among style murderers
Who wanna pile dirt on us
The word on the street is that we won't last long
And is it me?
But if the history of my city was passed on
Could we physically, in spirit and mind, find a way to move
And grab at this song?
And I was young but snuck in
Mahogany put stars in orbit
Unsupported foundation, we aborted sound
Allowed rape and now
It's a bar where men and women got to frequent
And spit a slick thing in each of your ear
And sip a mixed drink and beer for sport
And now the block can not hear
And how we got here
We’ll never know
They showed a broken up Hip Hop Shop board on VH1
Like, ""ay come here come see where they from""
And that shit was too hard for me to chew
Like I hate gum
And y'all can play dumb like Jim, man

I keep goin'
Even when I wanna stop
I keep goin'
Even when I wanna stop
Is it the release of the anger that makes me murder the tracks?
Or the silent majority turning their backs?
Is it the passion or the love or the drive or the faith?
Is it the knowledge that our lives are at stake?
Is it preparing for the moment when opportunity knocks?

Been on tour with bronchitis laryngitis
Every night I rock despite it
Some of these cats acting like they wearing diapers
And I keep keep on
Even when my hand tires
No labels or vampires
No funders or grantwriters
Inspired by freedom fighters
Before us and coming after us
For the present survivors of human massacres–
If you ""considered suicide when rainbows were not enough""
And bank rolls were clotted up
It's painful I brought it up
The truth gotta come out from different angles it's bottled up
Serve it with a ladle from the cradle til my body's dust
Nothin' else synonymous to the feeling I get from demanding respect
And knowing that I'm earning all my papes

Stay persistent you determining your faith

Always changing cause I learn from my mistakes

Up mornings and nights, with gas soaring in price
Got two daughters and wife; need food, water, and lights
Can't be on corners with dice, unsure of a bite
Needing two quarters for rice, a dollar short of a slice
The recordings I write got me boarding a flight
To somewhere foreign with sites I never saw in my life
The allure, loud roars, online orders and hype
You gotta close doors and windows, inside with the snipes
Shaking hands and flattery, fans on my battery
Some pissed, some mad at me
Many that listen happily
Overseas tours, boarding, camcorders catch me
Know I have a purpose, somehow people react to me
Artists that want me to feature that's saving cash for me
Producers that be waiting for payments that's saving tracks for me
Constantly I kill it, you agree that I'm the illest
Cause I've acquired what skill is, you've seen that I fulfill it
Keep goin'
Even when I could've stopped..
I jumped on the 33, hit the I-90
At the 390, I left that bullshit behind me
Reached up and pulled my rearview off like Aknell
Out like I was locked down and a nigga just got bail
Like I was hospitalized and a chick just got well
My only plans now are to follow my dreams
At the East 17, I felt a black cloud looking
I relaxed in my seat like I was smoking a spliff
U-Hauling it, pulling my shit behind me
Like 128th and St. Nick is where you'll find me
Cause upstate rest of New York is too grimy
And I'm never going back like Fleetwood Mac
Like a known special ed over my deep track
From the 81, 380, 80, tunnel to the bridge
I watched the eyes light up on the face of my kids
I stepped out, in disbelief of what we finally did

It's hard to get a glimpse of hope
When you against the ropes
Try to penny pinch but after bills and rent ya broke
Life it always throws a wrench like Emp at Interscope
You in the aftermath succumb to numb it with a drink or smoke
To ease the pain I sleep all day
Relieves the hangover from the E and J
Looking for a tunnels end a light to lead the way
But the shame has been ingrained into my DNA
Cause pops was a failure
Mom was on lithium
Always settled for less than the best
No one to pity 'em
No one to drop a pretty gem
At seven tied a plastic bag over my head
Like, ""What's the point of getting older and dead?""
So innocent, searching for missing links
Surrounded by the carcasses of instruments
Of dreams departed hardened by the sentiments
Out of tune and sharpened by the artists who neglected it
I'm scarred by my resemblance
Silly things
That I do to feel alive
I realize
I drink and I smoke
Scrambling for a hint of hope
My tight rope
You know the one where a rabbi, imam and pastor walk in
To a bar to discuss what happens if the caskets drop in
The one inside committed suicide
Family spastic sobbin'
The answers come in more flavors than Baskin-Robbins
Will god forgive 'em for the sin
And will they ever make amends
Or was it the last option off of the path they walked in?
Depending on if they believed in hell or heaven
Or if there was a chemical imbalance in their cerebellum
Or if the pain was overwhelming full of self loathing
Feeling plagued by failure like the first males chosen
Or what if hell's frozen, and life was only this purgatory?
Full of greed, and murder, war
See I know you heard the story
What if they wait and have faith to reincarnate?
With luck they won't be stuck again between a rock and hard place
Running in a hamster wheel
We wondering what answer's real
And star gaze pray someone above to keep our heart safe
I heard the barrels cry, wishing they could spare ya lives
Was feeling paralyzed but, no, I wasn't scared to die
Feared not livin' to the fullest so I pulled it
All or nothing
Now somebody wanna call my bluff when
I tried to flinch
Told them that the suicide attempt was cause I'd rather die
Than live and ride the bench
For every victory there's like 50 times the setbacks
For every revolution there's a death trap
And every time I see police attackin' with a TASER gun
A protester that's down already on the ground my face is stunned
I see people that's unaffected like ""that's just for safety, hon""
Turn around and tell myself: ""You're not the crazy one""
To all the unfazed and numb, hope that you hear
What I've spoken is clear
So you stop repressing choking the tears
We all walk the line between insanity and sanity
And hope and despair
Hope and despair
I realize
I'm as big as the sun in the sky
Wild dreams and mild denies
Slow raw and numb outside
I dream in the snow
I drink and smoke
Hint of hope

36196,Invincible,No Easy Answers,"In this track off her 2008 album Shapeshifters, Invincible rhymes about the complicated and confusing sides of love over a beat that samples “Love cats” by The Cure.
You know how people say, ""Love is the answer,""
Then what the fuck is the question?
L.O.V.E
Hell no
It isn't easy
Temp rising breathing faster
You can't get no easy answers
Study up and read the chapters
I can't get no easy answers
(True love) ain't the answer, said a former lover through the issues
But was it real or was it superficial?
If it's really (love)
Whether emotional abuse or if they bruise and hit you
Would you be confused or choose a loose or chipped tooth?
Why is it (love)
Needs a ring and city hall papers to prove official?
Is it something you fall in
Or a thing that soothe and lifts you? (love)
Defying gravity
But rather than the latter we
In Pat Benatar's ""Battlefield""
Where's the seminar to help a heart that's shattered heal?
Why rally up and chant for nation states that hate to reconciliate
When two people who loved each other can't?
Is it chemistry?
Cause if the recipe is off it leaves you saltier than MSG
We got (love) sparks
Like a finger in the socket by mistake
Is it the opposite of fear or opposite of hate?
Is your (love) guarded with your life
Locked up in a safe?
Or if it's free
Why you feeling trapped and plotting your escape?
Searching for greener pastures
I can't get no easy answers
Caught up in the heat of passion
You can't get no easy answers
Turning to complete disaster
I can't get no easy answers
Somebody deceived the masses
Cause there ain't no easy answers
(Love) Supreme like Coltrane
A no-brainer, do you try to own it
Or keep it open with no hang ups? (love)
Is it a baby in her mother's arms?
Or maybe it's the way you got me open with your southern charm?
No Ordinary (Love) and other songs by Sade
Sweet as agave
There's romance and slow dance but what about agape? (love)
Is it a verb or a noun?
Why some disturbed I prefer her and wish that we would burn to the ground?
Is it (love) only in between the sheets?
To me it's only true if I'm told when I got food between my teeth!
That's real (love)
Do you believe in soul mates or mating souls?
Why so many relationships just fill a gaping hole?
Instead of (love), Reflect, Elevate and Grow
Can you truly love another if you relegate your goals?
I heard (love) is breaking all the chains
Take away the pain
Live it
Flying higher than a thousand paper cranes
Temp rising breathing faster
I can't get no easy answers
Study up and read the chapters

Freedom is breathing the fresh air
And the feeling of rain on the face
As you came in this place
Yet shamed and disgraced
The plan was the state
Made sure she caught the blame in the case
Another number without a name or a face
2 million filling their prisons
Now they claimed it was safe
Prison bars start looking like bar codes
Freedom of soul
Case closed
By an arm in a dark robe banging a gavel
To send you traveling carloads
On gravel and stark roads
Like cargo
To a place where the heart grows cold
You hear another prison door slam shut
By hard-nosed politicians making commission
Off of starved souls and
Prisons monopolize the cash flow
Go directly to jail and do not pass go
I'm bound to get locked down
Than in a gown, cap, and tassel
Profiled the suspect
Handcuffed and shackled
The most attacked and hassled
By the cops in the hood
Though you at the top of the hood
And in the back with the lasso/lahso
The apso's gotta fill their quota of stocked goods
I might get the axe like chopped wood
It's not looking good
When the 5-0, the P.O.s, the D.A.s
The C.O.s are in large with the CEOs
They business partners
Come out with your hands up
Put 'em in handcuffs
We got locked
You hear another prison door slams shut
The door to opportunity closes
As it grows, the net profit it grosses
Come out with your hands up
Put 'em in handcuffs
We got locked
You hear another prison door slams shut
The door to opportunity closes
And then another prison door slams shut
He used to beat her mercilessly
But they wasn't coming around when she called the emergency
They said the state couldn't intercede
Until she made him bleed
Then they charged her in the first degree
Another door to opportunity closes
She discloses that she had a felony charge
On an application for a job
Its determination
What's she gonna do to survive?
There's no public assistance when you've got a drug conviction
Listen, you hear another prison door slam shut
Mandatory minimums
Can't ignore these are women
Living in unsanitary conditions
With strip searches by male guards
On cell blocks
Don't be shell-shocked
When I spit verses
The door to opportunity closes
When mothers lose custody
And nothing's for free
In the home of the brave
Where we get enslaved
If we don't behave
Who's the enemy?
The women we define as criminals?
Corporate crimes get a slap on the wrist
And defined as political
Say farewell to welfare
No one else hears
It falls upon deaf ears
Wage is minimal
Get down on (?)
The war on poor
Drugs, and terrorism
Is a war on the
Democracy we never had
Just look at Florida
Elections get obtained and extorted
Foreigners detained and deported
Over the border, facts distorted
Putting people in a cage
Judge 'em with your legal ways
Lethal injection is modern-day lynching
Ain't it a shame
We ain't taking preventative measures
Like building better schools
And starting a needle exchange
So when you locking people up
You imprison yourself
More than a prisoner who lives in a cell
Your fear of losing your false sense of security and material wealth
Got you a life sentence to a living hell
We tipping the scales
And then you hear a prison door open
We kicking down the door, now it's broken
We fighting for this freedom and hoping
Saying live from the D to Oakland
No more prisons in the '04!
No more prisons in the '04!
Say, no more prisons in the '04!
No more prisons in the '04!
You know, the 13th amendment abolished slavery for all except those who are being punished for committing a crime
So in a lot of ways what we see in the penitentiary system in this country is the continuation of the system of slavery
But the question is creating some new institutions, institutions that really will speak to the problems that people have, who go to prison.

Yes, it's here
The long-awaited
All these years of stompin' pavement
Cut the nonsense
Just accomplish
Ain't no way to rush the process
Born in Champaign, Illinois
Ever since then been on a campaign to fill the voids
And missing links I drips my ink on topics that you still avoid
Cynics say our troubles can't change, but I kill the noise
Heaters that's built to destroy
Speakers front to back – turn the volume up!
Smash these cats like Gallagher soon as I wrap the album up
Thought I'd never finish it
For more than minute I wished to end this shit
Put down my penmanship, and get a carpentry apprenticeship
Swinging sledgehammers for a minimum wage
Renovate a DV shelter for women with AIDS
Least I'd have some benefits and I could see a dentist quick
Still my thirst I wasn't quenchin' it by learning a trade
Chopped my signature braids
New beginning, enter the stage of nothing to lose, a hundred percentage to gain
Witness my train of thought, three minutes and change
It's the long-awaited song
I laid it over tracks that Vaughan created
Y'all been waiting
I've been making moves
Gotta do it right can't lose
Got my ducks lined up and I'm on my grind
Its the mission Invincible accomplished
You wanna classic? You gotta wait for it
You want good music? You gotta support it
You want change? It's a daily choice
You want a dope show than y'all should make noise!
I'm striving to be one of the best period
Not just one of the best with breasts and a period
Styles blessed with a myriad
We take the independent route and win
That's what my man Wes' theory is
Call me every A&R's worst nightmare
When your label drops ya fade to dark
We still bright glare
And this is razor sharp
I make my mark
We don't fight fair
Cause we taking ya spot
It's state of the art
Ahead of y'all by light years
Picture me rapping slow
Sample Barry Manilow
And switchin' up my baggy clothes for camel toes?
No, that'll have to go
I don't battle no more
Make an album so dope
You stranded up shit's creek without a paddle boat
I don't write rhymes
I write ransom notes
Demanding a check
Demanding respect
Demanding spins from hands on a deck

Phase two, rockets hit the Gaza Strip with phosphorus
Phase three, ground attack
How we gonna counter-act
Boycott, divest, and sanction
Boycott, divest, and sanction
Boycott, divest, and sanction
Israel, you should be ashamed
Kill and maim thousands of civilians in our name
Claiming you hitting terrorists but children in your aim
Even murder relief workers, blood spilling from they brain
While they tried to drive the ambulance
Damn they couldn't stand a chance
Even bomb students, hospitals, mosques, Rafah, and Khan Yunis
Shot em in the back like the cops to Oscar Grant
And in each case the good old United States sponsored that
Seven million a day that we pay tax
And AIPAC's lobbyists is robbing us
Sometimes it feels like there ain't no stopping this
But now nobody can deny it cause you made it too obvious
Naked truth exposed like the emperor's clothes
The struggle's getting hotter and the temperature rose
Since 1948, when you formed the state
Palestinian people still defending their homes
They ain't been surrendering, no
Boycott, divest, and sanction
Boycott, divest, and sanction
Boycott, divest, and sanction
Cause they even bombed the United Nations
Look, I'm Israeli, my government's so arrogant
War criminals who call Palestinian's terrorists
For resisting extinction and occupation
Comparing this to genocide and reservations of Native Americans
It's a massacre, kick out their ambassador
Divest from their apartheid like South Africa
Boycott em like King to Montgomery buses
Show them we want peace but only with real justice
They murdering the media and witnesses left
We gonna stop shopping at all the businesses that invest
In building their settlements and gentrifying our corners
Illegal walls over there and the US-Mexico border
Build a worldwide movement til the truth is heard
And supporting the Israeli's who refuse to serve
All the C.O.s who AWOL when deployed to Iraqi stations
All the people rallying while the cops are chasing
If we enlisted in the system, we got an obligation

Legends aren’t legends 'til they pass away
Do you wonder why we have to wait
'Til we bury they caskets or spreading they ashes
To be more than a half awake
Sleep on genius ahead of ya time
Style they could never define whether given credit to shine
His competitive rhymes battle shit protagonist role
Movie scripts had the actors flipped
His canvasses splattered with soul
Ephcee legacy hasn’t been told
And they called in the morning chasing the scoop
No time to mourn him late no excuse
Brought us together blessed us with beats
Rhymes live forever flesh obsolete
A mourner’s poem to the cornerstones
Two pillars Proof Dilla
So support ya own
When a momma gonna get to mourn her son?
The Reporters gone and recordings done
In this industry that extorts they young
Ask 'em for a fraction they short on funds
Many obstacles still
With payin' hospital bills
Now who could possibly steal
From an ancestor?
I’m givin' 'em everyone’s favorite hand gesture
Shady dealings made the millions try to buy the catalog
For less than what ya label’s willing
Lowest bidder for the path you paved with brilliance
Skills and passion city gonna stay rebuilding
Love your killer too–hating won’t bring you back
Stained ya name and covered up his dingy tracks
Lied you had an outburst and shot first
If we don’t stop this jealousy it’s 'bout to be a lot worse
No more moments of silence
We’ve been quiet for too long
That’s the same as betrayal
More than bare witness
To struggle speak out
Or be complicit
To these fake portrayals
In the D hold you a jazz funeral
March down Woodward in mass numerals
But it's like the levees breaking
They coulda prevented it
Not ya death but the premature event of it
Instead of prepare for the storm
We stare and ignore 'em
Cry in despair and just mourn
I’d rather repair and transform
Recharge your battery pack
But now it's after the fact
So what we want a pat on the back
For the courage and compassion we lacked?

I want to be with you
Yes you
Forever
Recollecting when we first met
Friends of yours advised me come pursue ya
Hypnotized by your spell and smell
Sprung by your perfume
I flew over – no delays or run-ins with the steward
Yeah, our love was younger, newer then
When we were honeymooners
Now our days with sun are fewer
Nights are numbered
Lunar eclipse, glitter and glitz
Hate to admit
Dismissed a hundred rumors
As imagination's figments
Spread like tumors
Diagnosed malignant
Radiation patient hunting for the cure
You’re so immature
Unreliable
Never liable
Blaming the entire globe
And call 'em evil-doers
But I’m sure
There’s no reparations
For sweat and lost energy
Considered best comrades
Became my worst enemy
Hurtful abusive
Blood curdles and oozes
Under the surface of epidermis
The purplest bruises
Truth is, you're gorgeous
But hunger for power gorges
With armed forces
Contorts your slim figure to enormous
Oh beautiful
With your spacious skies
I wanna love you but you hide behind a fake disguise
Oh beautiful
Planned your birthday party for July Fourth
I was dis-invited
Ride your high horse
To a black tie affair with your peers
Who can apply force
Oh beautiful
Really wanna make this fit
Promised me to change ya ways
But keep on repeating the same mistakes and slip
Blow your candles, make a wish
Erase the taste
In melting pots
Blood on auction blocks
Now felons caught in cells
I seldom thought
We’d 86 relationships
Obsolete like laser discs
Jealous thoughts possessive so in
Self defense I’m raising fists
Still you fail to hear
The trail of tears
And broken treaties
Border walls we
Wrote graffiti
Tag it like your toe
You’ll go alone and greedy
Even though you know you need me
No pretending we co-dependent
You killin' in my name I get the blame
Your co-defendant
So much arrogance
It's an embarrassment
See a therapist
For your paranoia of terrorists
While terrorizing
Analyze the flaws in your character
Do you really love me –
Or just lust for power -
America?
Your flirtatious eyes
Fiending for power
And the taste
Between the waist

1 ContributorState of Emergency LyricsIt's a state of emergency
It's a state of emergence see
Since ""Last Warning,"" I showed you I'm transforming
Like the grain that pass through hour glasses shaped by sandstorm wind
Put 'em in a trance with the recording
See the hands swarming
In the crowd I ran towards em
And my wing span soaring
Like I'm Flash Gordon with an aerial view
Of the mitten next to Ontario
I bury ya crew
Detroit city, shoot for three points hit me
From the top of the key like I'm on the Shock
And you shocked that it's me
While Kwame defending his texts and descending in debt
I got the opposition copping a plea
But musically we setting the standards
You cats are biting and forgetting your manners
While every sentence cinematic stretching the canvas
Paint a picture of war like Guernica
All you gotta do is let it bang turn it up!
I spit these flows
'Til I'm six below
My job's to make the ""revolution irresistible""
So listen close
Dangerous to speak the truth
That complicated the matters
I guess it's just an occupational hazard
In the trenches, I'm underground like the salt mines
Throwing the wrenches
Now they defenseless
We hit the fault lines
Awakening the senses we all blind
First I gotta make it through the entrance
By the time I hit the exit
You'll all rewind

36203,Invincible,Ransom Note,"Storm up to the door thinking that we kicking down using a Trojan Horse
It won't open with force, our moments short, so what's the last resort?
Picking the lock – plan B skeleton key sticking
Covered up in gloves and hats so they can't match our description
A.N.S. masked marauders
Hip hop's Doctors Without Borders
Operation: No More Lies
Kidnaps the daughter of a media mogul
Who hijacked the hip hop game
We took her to close the gap
We demand a prisoner exchange
Now, run in the back room. Don't nobody say shit
Helixx C grab that chick before she runs quick
Don't worry 'bout her man, he done made me mad
Fold that nigga like a dress shirt and throw him in a duffel bag
In the hummer now we're off as I proudly thought my crew
Initiates the long awaited media coup
A car passes blastin' music from the bullshit charts
Ain't no turning back from here, ANOMOLIES is going hard
There's been a big kidnapping
She screamed when the men burst in and started beating her fiance
The young heiress was forced into the trunk of a white car
Police say the whole thing was carried out with commando-like precision
What we received in the mail today appears to be a seven page statement plus a tape recording
And according to the demands, which we'll outline here, it says all these things must be publicized in full
Which is what we're doing now
Now, listen up people: This is our communiqué
If you want your daughter, be wise and do just what we say
Tell the truth, you own both right wing AMs full of haters
And the FMs who cater to the lowest common denominator
Tell the truth about payola-based quotas and your motives
To hold our attention so you sell it to the highest donor
Truth is, your companies wanting to stifle freedom of speech
'Cause without neutrality, the net will filter what you see
We resorted to these tactics 'cause you know you can afford it
We demand our own stations so our voices ain't distorted
We demand you break bread for the babies – they need educating
Updated books and computers for the future they're creating
We demand that you give us our wireless citywide
And make it free so we can truly end the digital divide
We demand that you stop making hip hop commercialized
Before it meets its own demise by the devil in disguise
Dad, I'm ok, I just hope that you'll do what they say, dad, and do it quickly
I just want you to know that I'm going to do everything I can to get you out of there
It's a little frightening because the initial demand is one that's impossible to meet
However, in the next 24-48 hrs I'll be trying my best to come back with some kind of a counter offer that's acceptable
A station, they said you could have it right here
Fill out this bureaucratic nightmare
They'll tell us if it's up to standard in 5 years
Gave excuses, no books or computers for the youth
Free stickers and hats to every single public school
They said they're giving us the wireless, it's trash
Taxing us with hidden fees they profit while we crash
Just because you throw a bone, that don't make it grub
Rap stars and Nascar, that's not what we asked for
You want your daughter? Come and get her
But when he arrived, surprise! All that he found was a letter
She said, ""Pops, I've known since I've been grown
You hijacked the minds of the masses, gave 'em Stockholm syndrome
I helped ANOMOLIES plot all along
To take your monopoly spot, and while you're reading this we're gone.""
Creating our own outlets even if it ain't out yet
Seeing typical trends through a critical lens
Making media, music, so you have no influence
Mobilizing a movement so your brainwashing is useless
There's an opportunity for a new society to be built
On people who are transforming themselves

Invincible, listen
Spittin', and I ain't gotta get permission
Metamorphosis
No better metaphor for this
Lyrics to part my lips, paint you a self portrait
Did my people make it out of Auschwitz
In order to become our own oppressors?
Present situation is torturous
A fortress is built, twenty-five feet tall
I think that's five feet of concrete
Apartheid wall
It's called a security fence
But all I see as far as the eye stretches
Are superiority complex
New dawn, and awakening
Eyes wide open to the lies spoken paper thin
No life times frozen
Keep changing, no faking or playing
Pretend I'm hoping
To step outside without choking on breaking wind
From factory smoke, this is sulfur not sess
Schools closing chapters, getting ulcers from the stress
Breathing that gives you asthma is hazardous to your health
Just to be an inhabitant in the city where you rest
It's a quest for the spirit of resistance (resistance)
You can hear it in the distance if you listen
Persistence
So what we fighting for?
The day were you ain't even got to fight no more
And that's the vision
Risen up to heights we soar
I hope I opened up a can of worms
With all these anecdotes
Cause you can never candy-coat the truth
And once you know it, proof
Then you can't ignore it
Yo' Che, equip 'em with this handy quote
{Bridge}
At the risk of soundin' ridiculous
True revolutionaries guided by feelings of love
Give a hundred percent
Demolish buildings and spilling civilians' blood
Collective punishment
But you know what I meant
The new dawn
Sun rising on the horizon
It's a new day
Every opportunity lies, in the crisis
I'm giving this my all when I write this
We in it for the long haul
No Compromises
{Revolution x 6}
(Verse 2)
Slap a cop like Zsa Zsa Gabor
I'm ready like Helen to tell 'em I want a divorce
In the wedding vows they promised to protect and serve, but
We battered wives don't even get respect we deserve (analyze)
Increased police presence
Adolescents get sentenced as felons
And there's never no preventative measures
To help us change the conditions, respectfully
Without putting the life on the line
For this industry to referee
There's a discrepancy, of good cop bad cop
Every cop operates with injustice as the back drop
So for the have-nots
Survival is padlocked
Inside of the jackpot
We ripping it to shreds
You ask what came first?
The chicken or the egg?
But they both foul and rotten
Laws, politicians, they plot 'em
And the cops on patrol, keep us locked in parole
Man they all getting coal in their stockings, so
Apathy's not an option
For all the lessons in life that you learn
We're not stopping until we're getting a right of return
To all the Zionist denying us, listen
(We're tireless)
It's a new dawn
Sun rising on the horizon
It's a new day
Every opportunity lies, in the crisis
I'm giving this my all when I write this
We in it for the long haul

Just another way for you to stay untouched
Now you tell me that you were mine

36207,Invincible,Perfectionists [Mixed],"Why you up in the game if you ain’t trying to be the best at it?
Makin' this music less stagnant
A lotta y’all claim to be the best – well, let’s have it
Or I’m blowin' holes all up in your flows like mesh fabric
You lovin’ the sound of your own voice
I hold mics like I’m pro-life, leaving you no choice
But to put it down now, come to terms with your sloppiness
It's obvious, my passion's what your hobby is
Got a strong hunger for makin’ the song butter
Regardless what you called, but you dialed the wrong number
The sky’s the limit, applying 110 percent
Remove the timid like removing old trends
(Don’t hate on me)
Because I stay givin' 'em more than what they bargained for
(And all the weak retreat)
Like they fleein' out of a project door
Setting the score, resting assured
I‘m destined to soar
Blessing each session, I reckon you want more
Of that rare commodity
The quality is what it’s gotta be
Yet my philosophy is much farther than what your eyes could see
We the best in this
Close enough don’t cut it
Ain’t no estimates
We perfectionists
We work hard for the money
But the question is
Y'all work hard for y’all money?

Perfectionists
First we’re gonna bring the shit
‘Cause we know we rippin’ it
Infinite like arithmetic, while you impotent
Every time that we deliver it, this shit’s deliberate
Break it down into increments for the ignorant
Intricate, using my vocal chords to open doors
You'e a hopeless cause
Leave you with a broken jaw
Bring applause in cycles like menopause
We perfectionists
Got you open for more
Since I first ripped it
My life has been immersed in this
Now I know I’m maaad nice – and I'm my worse critic
Every word spitted with perseverance
To outshine your whole tape with my guest appearance
You step to this? I doubt it, but I’m a pessimist
Come get a glimpse, how I make it look effortless
Never in a hurry, 'cause it’s all about the journey
If you heard me, you’s the jury
My words serve as my attorney
You half-assed cats get the fast cash
Need to rock a gas mask, now see who got the last laugh
In exposin' the notion – I’m hopin' to find a closin’ to my question
(What’s your question, Helixx?)
Why is half an exception?
Exception to the rules for half-assed, half-willin’ and half-able
Halfway is not half of the bill to pay cable
Frustrated, 'cause I’m one of the last of the Mohicans
Master of my craft – the head of my class without speakin'
(Why?)
'Cause I stay progressin', only see success when I never settle for less
I must confess – I’m a perfectionist
Diggin’ deep like The Exorcist
The rest are now passin' the buck – show them the exit, kid
We the best in this
Close enough don’t cut it
Ain’t no estimates
We perfectionists
We work hard for the money
But the question is
Y'all work hard for y’all money?

You know you really love pulling fast ones
Cheat, come home, and act dumb
Pussy nigga, pussy nigga, listen nigga

I just hold it in like it's pitching time
I've been holding back for a long while

Call up Keenan, tell him I need him
Niggas ain't loyal
And I knew from the jump when you showed me the ropes
That I wouldn't ever have trust for you
You creep in, I'm leaving
You call me, I pick up, I hang up
You text me, “Let's link up”
Then I just say, ""Fuck it""
Then we end up fucking
And you start up something I said I was done with
Then it all repeats in the next two weeks
I be back on the same ""I'm done"" shit

They give you a chance to believe, believe in something
Is that too much?
Cause I've been on the search and I'm losing my hope
Is that too much? Is that too much?
Tryna find love in a world so cold
Oh, is that too much?
I just want an answer, I can't be the only one
Is that too much?
You ain't gotta be perfect
Just give me a purpose to love
I just want somebody—body

Won't be like everybody—body
All you gotta do is love me for me, babe
I just want somebody—body
To treat me like somebody—body
Won't be like everybody—body
All you gotta do is love me for me, babe
Now don't be mislead by the things that I've said
In the past I was young, I was looking for a thrill
That didn't last long, I was in it for the wrong
Wrong reason, wrong season, wrong person (yeah)
Cause he just wanted one thing and I just wanted something
To smile at and live for and hug on (ohh)
I'd rather have quality than quantity
Ohh, I just want someone that'll keep it real with me
Is that too much?
Cause I've been on the search and I'm losing my hope
Is that too much? Is that too much?
Tryna find love in a world so cold
Oh, is that too much?

I can't be yours, baby, you know I be on tour crazy
If only you were mine, if only you were mine

Stress theyself out tryna be my favorite bitches

But you, I fuck with you, 'cause I get you, you like my clue
I don't judge you, but don't try me, if I'm with you, that's 'cause I choose
Anyway, I'ma keep it a hundred, I like the way you penetrate
Would've said I love it, but you gon' manipulate and just take that anyway
Every time you ask me what we gon' be, I just grin and say
""Even if we fall off, I don't wanna let that take my friend away""
I'm honest, I ain't gon' lie to your face and you 'posed to appreciate it
Otherwise, go 'round the way and let them suckers grease you, baby
Gas you, ride 'til you on E and go right past you (Skrrt)
And now you stuck on still until them junkyards come and smash you
I ain't gon' lie, I see a good girl sometimes, when I look in your eyes, more times
I just see through your ways, your waist lead me straight to your thighs
Plus, I don't know what's on your mind
Always need your friends to cosign
Never ask for you to be mine

Your money long, but your head gone, my friends tellin' me don't
Problem is, you a street nigga and you always sendin' me off
Truly, you are my best friend, I fell in love and I can't pretend
Vibe right, so don't fall back, if we go together, just call it that
See, I show you off 'cause I ain't ashamed of you
I'm just sick of playing all these guessin' games with you
Tatted on me, we skin deep, and I ride with him, no DMV
Test-drive it, it's all yours, I miss you there when you on tour
Understand you a boss man, you busy gettin' your hustle on
But every nigga got one bitch that he call on when he fee alone
Bottom bitch, your main thing, your best drug, your worst pain
Your girlfriend, your confidant, these niggas actin' so nonchalant
But I know you need this, it ain't no secret

Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling
All...
Million, million
Like a million, million, million, people told me
Not to trust in you
But there's a million, million, million, million reasons why
I fuck with you
Cause you touch my spirit, can you feel it, give me that
There's a passion for it, can't ignore it, give me that, love
Cause your love give me goosebumps
You're the right one when I need some, I call you
Real love never gives up on a Tuesday
If it does rain, you come through
Your love's like a big hug on a bad day
Just what I need in my life
You're one in a million
When I wake was the first thing on my mind
Your love's like my drug, I can't live without it
That's just what you do to me boy
For your love I'd proudly climb a mountain
Cause that's just what you do to me boy
You are, yeah, yeah, you are
One in a million, one in a million, one in a million to me

Goes on and on and on
(Somethin' you do to me)
Goes on and on and on
(Somethin' you do to me)
Goes on and on and on
(Somethin' you do to me)
Your love's like a back rub when I back up
And you catch what I throw down
Your love's what I breathe from, I would go numb
If you left me here right now
Our love gets stronger when we break up
We'll be right back in no time
And our love's made of concrete when you rock me
I just feel so safe and
Like a million, million, million, people told me
Not to trust in you
But there's a million, million, million, million reasons why
I fuck with you
I fuck with you, in love with you, I run with you, oh yeah
I fuck with you, in love with you, I run with you, oh yeah
Your love's like my drug, I can't live without it
That's just what you do to me boy
For your love I'd proudly climb a mountain
Cause that's just what you do to me boy
You are, yeah, yeah, you are
One in a million, one in a million, one in a million to me

You give me a really good feelin'
You can make life worth livin'
You can be the piece i'm missin'
Love is a maze and we get through it when we just listen
You can be the voice I carry
You can be the man I marry
We can have this for a very
Long time, what's the wrong time
When the right time is a life time
You remember back when

The official music video was released on March 26th, 2015.
What's up Tim?
Going in right here
Uh
I been at this thing for years, it's done turned me to an animal
Some of y'all ratchet, I'm a write you hoes a manual
Step by step, G shit for you to keep
This the ratchet commandments, I need a moment to preach
(Thou shalt not) fuck up on a nigga
When you know he got a missus, you are labeled, side bitches
(Thou shalt not) lie upon the bible
How you looking for a title when you sleeping with his rivals?
(Thou shalt not) put trust in these men
These niggas are now bitches, quit acting so feminine
(Thou shalt not) pacify the truth
If you know your pussy loose, you a ho, so do better
(Ratchet)
Every night doing the most up on Instagram
(Ratchet)
Ooh, maybe that's the reason why bitches, they can't keep a man
(Ratchet)
Man, y'all can't sit with us
(Ratchet)
Ha, ha, ha, listen while I preach, church
These bitches ain't really friends, she probably gon' take her man
I'm done with the phony hoes, these bitches is really bugs
They rather be on the block than taking care of the crib
I'd rather be making money than taking care of some kids
(Thou shalt not) slip up on a heathen
Always keep it cool, never let him know you need him
(Thou shalt not) let a nigga see you sweat
Fuck a bitch and get the check, move along, you know the rest
(Thou shalt not) respond to these bitches
They envy what you doing and they only want attention
(Thou shalt not) pacify the truth
If you know your rent due, get the fuck out the club
(Ratchet)
Every night doing the most up on Instagram
(Ratchet)
Ooh, maybe that's the reason why bitches, they can't keep a man
(Ratchet)
Man, y'all can't sit with us
(Ratchet)
Ha, ha, ha, listen while I preach, church
I told Tim like, I'm irritated, devastated
I thought, I thought we had some young queens, what you mean?
We act belligerent, generation of ignorance
Bitches live for the 'Gram so they life ain't got no significance
Boy this shit be a trip like Expedia
She won't pick up a book but she'll probably bust it open for social media
Man, you'd be surprised, cuffing and loving and fucking the team
Getting by just by living and making it work on they knees
Let's not debate it, these bitches is overrated
They probably will never learn cause they lacking in home training, yo
But niggas lying on they money like every day
And niggas ratchet too, just in another way
You fake fathers never held your daughters, never had a conversation
You too fucking immature to get an occupation
(Ratchet)
Every night doing the most up on Instagram
(Ratchet)
Ooh, maybe that's the reason why bitches, they can't keep a man

Talk to me mentally, wise from a symphony
'Cause you can’t hear and I can’t stand with all this arguing
Tried to connect with me, I found the epiphany
Like a mystery, you don’t seem to be
Who you were back then, now you’re just giving up
Now I’m swerving, thoughts start turning
I gave you all the signs and you still ignore it
So what the fuck am I to do?
Just get me to an empty room
No signal on this road we’re going down
Shut up, by now you'd have it
Can't fix one thing in silence
You say you care but you don't care like how I care
And that's fucked up
And what hurts the most is you don't want my love
My love, no
Can't explain men
Say what you wanna hear, they will
You’ll never understand how it feels, no, no
Trying to get through to a person
Who can't, who can't, who can't
Feel what you feel
Say what you wanna hear, they will
You’ll never understand how it feels, no, no
Trying to get through to a person
Who can't, who can't, who can't
Feel what you feel
I wanna feel deep with your actions
I wanna feel more than attraction
I wanna get deeper then deep
If it’s not what I think then I think you should be more clear
Tell me you was down for the ride
I guess now the rules don’t apply for a nigga
And if we can’t draw close, baby, you’ll never get that picture
So talk to me but mentally, I wanna feel that chemistry
That we both had, we both had
My heart’s in between my mind
I love you but love is blind
It’s clear to see we’re going down
Shut up, by now you'd have it
Can't fix one thing in silence
You say you care but you don't care like how I care
And that's fucked up
And what hurts the most is you don't want my love

Read More Uh, uh
They say pussy is pussy, don't let it phase you
Shit after all the tears and affection, that's what it came to
You show a nigga love and he manage to hide it all
He won't admit when he's wrong, but I'm petty for movin' on
You got a lot to learn, you still young and immature
I bought into all your lies, you're such an entrepreneur
Fuck you, you know you hurt me in the worst way like Jhene said
Painted this false image like I was some sort of JPEG
Thought that I was special, you told me you would be gentle
You used me like a rental, that really fucked with my mental
I thought this shit was love and I'm tellin' people be straight
I'm embarrassed, same nigga been cheatin' right in my face
I got a lot to learn, act like I'm cool but it still burns
Sad to know that loyalty ain't nothin' but a vague word
I used to let you say anything like a dummy
Now all I ever think when you try to tell me you love me is, ""It sounds good""
Do you know just what, just what you done to me?
Oh, what you done to me?
Do you know just what, just what you done to me?
Oh, what you done to me?
'Cause I thought that I was good enough
I thought we had a lot of drugs
I thought you would be faithful if I wasn't goin' through your stuff
I thought I was the only one
I thought this here was more than fun
I thought that if I gave it up, you wouldn't need to find you none
I thought that I meant more to you
I thought that all your homies knew
I thought that you were special
You was nothin' more than stressful
Man, I thought we had a bond
Shit, I thought that you was mine
What I thought that it was real
You turned around and played a field, I gotta go
They say pussy is pussy, don't let it phase you
Hardest part about it is hopin' he doesn't change you
'Cause now my heart cold and I'm lookin' for my revenge
I'm fuckin' with niggas' heads and they payin' for what he did
I'm sorry, I guess I'm just broken and need healin'
I put it all on the line and he ruined my sense of feelin'
Wasted all of my time and that's somethin' I won't get back
So whenever I'm movin' forward, it's hard for me to adapt
You don't get it, I'm insecure all because of you
It make me look bad when the bitches ain't even cute
You just had to fuck it up, you was lovable, I was gullible
You ain't supposed to know that my nigga is untouchable
They supposed to envy, what we got is re-embellishment
You not supposed to like 'em, you supposed to make 'em jealous
What the fuck? Now every other nigga's outta luck
'Cause even if they do me right, I still hurt 'em out of spite
Like it sounds good

You bring the sun to my yard and
The rain to my garden, and the milk to my carton
I see the horizon, looking in your eyes and
Man, I'm just being honest
You put the count to my steps
Stance to my heart cause it beats through my chest for you
For you, for you
You are the block to my circuit
The change to my pocket
The one that I rock with
Mate to my soul, rock to my roll
Trail that I take when I'm tryna make it back, home
You are the bell to my door
Sweat to my pores
Summer in the box when I'm nailed to the floor
Cone to my ice cream
Chest that I hide in when it's lightning and I'm frightened
You're the Friday to my weekend
My life vest when I'm in the deep end
You are H2O, H2O
Soup to my cold, Film to the roll
Love doesn't fold
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
You put the smile in my cheek bones
You are the one that I need close
You are my clock in the am
Summer time is when we lay in
You're the lace to my shoes
Cup to my booze
One that I call late night when I'm loose
Stars to my sky
Wheels to my ride
Reason that I dropped off every other guy
You're an angel in disguise
Boy you really make me fly
Only man that has my eyes
I just enjoy, your sense of humor
You're like a tumor
You're in my head all day
You rock my world like outer space

(I won't tell your secrets)
(Your secrets are safe with me)
(Oh baby if there is anything that you fear)
(Anything, anything, anything)
I think I really gotta get personal
I got to really let y'all in on, these oppressed emotions
Look
My boyfriend is my bestfriend, and my bestfriend is my better half
He motivate me when I'm feeling lazy, he the best thing that I ever had
He know my flaws and he know my past
But it never matters 'cause he still with me
It feel good to have you by my side
On them cold nights when I don't feel pretty
Them old nights when I shed tears
'Cause I heard the things that them niggas said
I ran to you, when I laid with you
And you never ask whats in between my legs
You never judge me for the things I did
You heard the rumors, but you never tripped
'Cause that was then, and baby this is now
When you got my word, I won't let you down
I promised to love you with all that I got
You can have everything and I won't take it back
'Cause I'm in it too deep, and I can't go a week
Without seeing your face and feeling your embrace
This shit is real, shit is real
I'll say it again, cause this shit is real
And I don't care how these niggas feel
Cause you understand what they never will
And that's me
I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
Oh baby if there is anything that you fear
Anything, anything, anything
Oh baby if there is anything that you fear
Have you ever been so stuck in love
Feel like every move just wants a bit
But I'm still grateful, and I ain't complaining
'Cause a lot of women never find this
See it's hard to find somebody ready
It's even harder, keeping things steady
Cause faithful dudes, they don't come around
So when he come home, better take him down
I'ma freak on his body
I'ma cook and clean his laundry
I'ma treat my man so fucking good
And it's so lame, but he heaven sent
And without him, I'm not confident
If I can make it, or I can hold it
I tell him things, this is what he told me
I won't tell (Promise that you won't tell my secrets) your secrets
(Promise me that)
Your secrets are safe with me
(It made me feel, it made me feel goodgood to know that he was in my corner)
He slowed me down when I moved fast
When the other guys are just soaring past
He noticed me, he cool with me
When I told him I was going through some things
He held me down, he picked me up
Ran from me when I had enough
He laugh with me and he cried with me
And the time we spend, it's happening
It's your love
'Cause you know, guys don't really care about your feelings
You know, it just makes you feel good to know that there's somebody who's looking for you
And somebody that's gonna be there and always
And always have your back like...
Somebody who's always gonna look out for you
I really can't find anybody, anybody like but him so

You can’t even make time for a real bitch
The one that hold your weight when you’re working outta state
How you gonna play me?
Look
And I ain’t even been up on the block
I’m tryna make it happen, girl, look at all my knots
And all the loud talking need to stop
You know you gonna be with me at the top
When them other bitches not
I gotta get this cake so I moved state to state
I ain’t called, baby, ain’t wanna rub it in your face
Tell five minute background stay up in his place
Just wait till I slide, he can say it to my face
Ain’t nobody in the background
Why you gotta be so petty
Heard you fucking on a bitch named Cheley
Heard you was all in her spot, giving her what I got
Man, I don’t even think that you hear me
When you was in the jail, I was writing them letters
Couldn’t make bail, I was stackin that cheddar
But you don’t even care, all you wanna do is play
All you really care about is what the guys gonna say
Why you gotta give em something to talk about
Everybody got opinions but it don’t mean shit to me
I set my own lane, can’t no nigga get to me
If I fuck myself up, it just wasn't meant to be
And yeah yeah, you'll hold a nigga down
But really that’s the reason why I need you around
We gonna argue and fight when a nigga leave town

Calm down, why you talking loud
I put it all on the line when you’re not around
And you complaining about hoes in another town
But you forgot all the Gucci, the Prada, Chanel
The days Dolce and Gabbana, riding around foreign cars, Benihanas
Them hoes in the street still can’t get a dollar
What’s the problem
Man, fuck that Gucci, just look how you do me
You think that designer make up for this shit
I buy my own Prada, man, that’s not the problem
The problem is you too caught up with that bitch
I need you to come home and give me that D
I need you to not leave the crib when I’m asleep
I need you to act like a man and stay true to the plan
If you ready, I’m ready, come on
Look, all this yelling and saying who wrong
Gone keep going on and on
So turn off your phone and repeat your favorite song
Just lay back and play along cause I’m tired of talking
You the only damn thing besides my money on my mind this often

Seems like everybody changed on me
People that I used to know
They don't come around no more
Ever since we made it
Friends that I once knew look at me different now
Since we made it
I'm getting random calls from family
That's from out of town
Ya day ones be the main ones
That will talk down when you're not around
If you let 'em in, and it's all bad 'cause we go back
And I doubt that we were too close, for the jealousy
And you hate that we don't talk much
Should've call more, should've made time, that's true
I should've did that, could've did that, would've did that
But you know the phone works two ways
So don't get offended when I can't really hang for the night
We'll be alright, just know that I'm chasing that dough
I got you as soon as I blow, blow

The song was released on the December 9, 2016, alongside “Mc Hammer (Freestyle).”
I feel like we're in a
Different time zone
I'm gonna write this right
Look, I was single for a while, so it's taken me a while
To open up my thoughts, been feeling so lost, you don't know the half of it
Can you ride with me, talk with me, even if you are busy?
Really split your heart with me?
I'm at my job and I need you real bad (Bad)
Pick me up at six, I'm squeezing you while we kiss, yeah (Oh)
I'm squeezing you while we kiss, yeah
I've been numb to my feelings, feelings don't really last
Sorry if I repeat, but them niggas did in my past (Past)
Yeah, you roll a blunt, I twist it and hit it once
You rubbing me while I'm high, it's something that you provide
We catch a movie on the couch and then we turn it off
I know you hard, but you make me feel real soft
And maybe that's exactly what I need
Someone that can ease all my anxieties, look what you bring
Real love (Real love), real joy (Real joy)
We hit the floor and now we making real noise
And I don't think you know what you mean in my life
Yeah, stoned as a mountain, wetter than a fountain
Told him he gon' pay for this pussy like his accountant
Keep it real, we can chill
I'm concerned with how you feel (How you feel, how you feel)
Nothing more, nothing less, let me lay under your chest
When you with me, I'm impressed, boy, you got it and you blessed
Put your body in my legs when we cuddled up
You got my heart and I hope that you don't fuck it up
I don't really let my guard down anymore
Last love hit me and I'm still pretty sore
Don't overthink it, I'm thinking 'bout it with something new
One in the morning, you moaning while I'm on top of you
Knew it was real when I got to meet his mom
You spend the night and wake up to it, no alarm
We got a chemistry, a real strong bond
He better listen when I wanna clear my mind
You my therapy, blessing when you stab at me
Only nigga fucking me, hope that you ain't judging me (Judging me)
Yeah, better have than this, no amount of cash
That could ever come between us, fuck who don't believe us
You in my dream like Martin Luther King
King size bed, making love up on the springs
Spring to the fall (Fall), fall to the winter (Winter)
I'm so in love and I hope that you consider
Making me your girlfriend (Making me your girlfriend)
Making me your girlfriend, I'm ready for commitment
Yeah, yo
Spent four hours 'bout the way you made me feel
You call me up, I hear your voice and get the chills
Don't overthink it, I'm thinking about you every week
One in the morning, I'm moaning while you on top of me
You real and I like how you show your emotions
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa) Clear as the ocean, no more lies
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa) No more lies

You wasn't there when I was alone (Alone)
Say that you care, when really you don't
It's all in your actions, none of my fault
'Cause I ain't the kind you put to the side whenever you want
There must be something to hide (To hide)
Feel like when you're on my line
There's someone around to stay in the cut, ooh-ah
So do me a favor, show me the paper
I'm not in the mood to cry anymore
That ain't the vibe that I'm going for
Thought you were cool, all of it's fake
Told you before that money and girls are never replaced
All that I gave you, all that I am
You're just a boy who can't be a man
You're spendin' time away all night
I need you here by my side
You said you'd be around for life
You don't even call my line
Yeah, yeah, I'm feelin', I'm feelin' a way
Yeah, yeah, why all a sudden you change?
Nothin' with you is the same
I don't know how to explain
All we ever do is fuss
Ain't no way to make this up
You're acting different (Mmm, hmm)
So different (Mmm, mmm)
Different (Mmm, mmm)
So different
What did I say, or what did I do?
You can't even talk or look in my eyes when I'm in the room
So why would you act like this was a home?
Dealin' with girls who cannot compare to nothin' I'm on
I'm feelin' so disrespected
I cannot even accept it
You're so out of line for wastin' my time, and
Now you're neglectin'
Wildin' out in public
You just love to switch up the subject
I'm so tired of you flippin' and fumblin'
Say I'm trippin' on you over nothin', but
Look at yourself, you're doing me bad
It's all in your tone, you hang up the phone and never call back
What do I do? Start up a fight?
I hate to be wrong, I knew all along that this wasn't right
You're spendin' time away all night
I need you here on my side
You said you'd be around for life
You don't even call my line
Yeah, yeah, I'm feelin', I'm feelin' a way
Yeah, yeah, why all a sudden you change?
Nothin' with you is the same

Keep that shit trill
Most dudes can't handle me
Most dudes can't handle me

Kush too fucking strong, we been rolling all night
If your nigga do you wrong, bet this blunt gon' make it right
Hit it once, and hit it twice
Hit it three times, then you lit
It's like I'm honest when I'm sober, but I'm better when I'm lit
When i'm lit
When i'm lit, when i'm, when i'm lit
When i'm lit, when i'm, when i'm lit
When i'm lit, when i'm, when i'm lit
When i'm lit', when i'm, when i'm lit
Look, what if I told you that I like you but I love your money
Would you hide all of your visa's and start acting funny
What if I told you, you my main but I got other dudes
And every time I ain't with you, I'm with my other moves
If I kept it trill and told you that I need my space
You irritate me, every time you show up at my place
What if I told you that you bore me and it's no longer fun
And why we talking, I been texting two niggas at one
Is that too much? News flash, did you get that picture?
I hate yo' mama, she too nosey
Right along with yo' sista'
What if I told you that I care, but I don't care enough
Told him it was on silent, but it wasn't
I just ain't pick up
And I really don't give no fucks, love has been erased
I had to clear out all our memories, this shit can't be saved
And I could be wrong, but we leaning right
All these niggas wanna do is cut, get them out of sight
Look, what if I told you that I lurk on all your twitter mentions
And I get jealous, every time you show these hoes attention
What if I told you that I used to cry like every night
Used to ask the Dear Lord, why?
Like why we can't just get it right?
I'm just being one hunnit, this shit hella' true
And since we being honest, I been cheating too
What if I told you that your guys ain't really your dawgs
I would show you messages, but I delete them all
But I'm starting not to care, cause it's becoming pointless
It's like my heart feels out of place, I guess I'm double jointed
No double dates, what if I told you to your face
See your best man, is your best friend
But your best friend is my new man, hold on
I think that's too strong, karma lighten up
And if you mad I wrote this song, I still don't give a fuck

Damn, yo I been calling for the passed hour
And you ain't picking up?
Man, just hit me back
Did I not give you 25 chances?
Did you not take what all I gave for granted?
Did I not make it clear that we was drifting?
Did you not think how much you'd ever miss this?
I was head over heels like a tumblr
You was tripping when you gave her your number
Did I not do enough for your respect?
Reason why I reject every phone call in the evening
I'm busy all the time now
Ain't really much to say once you've shown how you get down
I keep it on my conscience, ""Never trust no nigga cause they all got options""
Look at the flick of the wrist
I look at the way that you gotta regret everyday waking up to ya bitch
I look at the way that ya gotta feel when I'm out here doing well
And you only can see it through that pic
You know you took an L for this and
I'm good on you now
So just keep your distance
You could keep your stories
Cause they tend to bore me
Save the altercations
I don't have the patience
To argue
And That's how he knows
That I'm good on my feet
When I see him in the streets
""Who are you?""
Baby you took that L
It's my turn to give you hell
Taste of your own medicine, medicine, medicine
Taste of your own medicine, medicine, medicine
Baby you turned me cold
It's your turn to have a dose
Taste of your own medicine, medicine, medicine
Taste of your own medicine, medicine, medicine
You gotta go tonight
Pack up your shit goodbye
And you already know I
I'm over your fucking game

But everything you said was part of another lie
The way you did me wrong is something you can’t deny
When you cheated on us, man that hurt me the most

I’m the reason that you even got your life on track
Where am I supposed to run now
I can’t do this on my own

Fuck around, make me have to pull up and embarrass ya

It’s the part where you take charge and make me moan

Can we both unfold
Take this to another level

So if you wanna roll one tonight, that’s okay with me

You’re the picture perfect boy, I kept it ten times ten, went against my own friends
I must been outta my mind, why didn't I peep all the signs, signs

Confused like a Capricorn and that's the reason that I'm also torn
Your bad for me like a Cancer, selfish like a Taurus
My mind's telling me to leave tonight but you fuck me good just like a Gemini, oh

Da da da
You say you hate when I jump to conclusions
I just hate when you act so clueless
Show me I can be definite
'Cause all I've ever seen is you leavin' from the club with a woman every time that you go out and step in it
I'm really regrettin' this
Meetin' you lettin' you fuck up my pattern 'Cause now that you matter I gotta deal with the good and bad
I gotta deal with the thoughts of you and them in bed
Soft spot for the boy I got it
Met him in college need 'em like bat need robin
He the best thing and the worst thing
If I'm the one you really love then why would you ever hurt me
Sit in my room, sit in my room and I assume shit
Love hurts and I'm guessin' I just bruise quick
Sleep on it in the bed alone then I call 'em 'cause I need 'em and I love 'em even when he wrong
Real love (real love, real love, real love)
What they know about real love?
Real love
Real love
Everyone plays the fool sometimes
Real love (real love, real love)
Let's talk about that real love
Real love
Real love
Everyone plays the fool sometimes
Send me a sign if you got my back
I'm lookin' towards the sky and it all seems black
I been cryin' in this car with the windows rolled
I'm outta control
I'm waitin' on which way do I go
I gotta man that knows me better than myself
What if I leave and I never find nobody else
Don't wanna start from the top and do this over again
I want the nigga that I found back in twenty-o-ten (2010)
Is it real love?
Cause I know what we had but it's nothing like what we have now
Man you're not the person that I knew
But I'm tryin' cus it's you
I'm lyin' to myself cus I do
Wanna make it work when it won't
Say you'll change but ya don't
Happens every time
You feed me the same lies
Tell me I can't go 'cause it's
Real love (real love, real love, real love)

A is for Aaron, he always running my errands
And when I tell him to hurry, he know to make me come quick
B is for Brendon he's got a fetish for spending
So when he bought me that Beemer, I took a ride on that dick
C is Calvin, he got a whole lot of talent
Say he grew up in the islands, know how to roll with his tongue
D is for Dylan, he doesn't stop 'till I feel it
That's why I call him policeman, he come around and I run
E is for Eric, he love when I share it
Let's talk about Frankie, I love when he spank me, you what I'm on
G is for Gerald, I met him through Herald
The I is for Ian, I can't deny he make me cry when he eat it
I got a lot of y'all niggas in my phone
Can't forget the J for Jerome
He kissed me so soft and he own his own loft
Drunk a little bit of wine, then he got it from behind
K is for Kevin, we caught it quits in '07
I had my eyes upon Larry, we even thought to get married
But that was dead, I'd rather lay with Michael instead
N is for Nicholas, love to send me freaky picks
Can't fuck wit Osiris , he's the type that's into leaking shit
P is for Prestin, I cheated on him with Quintin
But I left that boy by his lonely when I found out they was homie's
You know the R is for Rico, we got one hella of a dino
The S is for Sean, that boy can go 'till it's dawn
You know the T for Tyron, like having sex on the phone
Until I called on Ulises, decide to cook and do dishes
Serve me up like a servant, that reminds me of Vernon
Got a stack like his daddy, said I'd be rich if he had me
I think he wanna have my daughter
To bad I'm waiting on this pretty nigga that I know named Walter
He likes to get x-rated more than in Xavier
Never asked why till I felt it in my pancrea

You must been cooling with that other chick
Damn I can’t stay mad at you, put up with my attitude
And if I never told you thanks I’m showing you my gratitude
For being there and picking up listening when I won’t shut up
Promise not to hurt me, cause if you do then who can I trust
Lay my head up on his shoulder, tell me it’s gonna be alright
Sometimes I can’t even sleep unless I hear his voice at night
Momma she don’t understand it, everything ain’t so romantic
Everything ain’t squeaky clean but still I stayed up on your team
Cause I done did my wrong too, cried for me I cried for you
Hoping you forgive me cause if you ain’t rocking with me I might lose it
Put you before this music cause way before the fame the only one that knew my name was you you you
Everybody knows regardless of these hoes when it’s said and done we got that special one we can’t leave
No matter where we go you’ll always be my very first love and the one I need
Cause I can’t find nobody, treat me like you treated me I know that you’re down for it all
This why I admire everything you do, give me thirty minutes let me sing to you
Regardless of these hoes when it’s said and done, we got that special one we can’t leave
So let me love you while the background music fades, fades, fades
Let me love you while the background music fades
Love you in the a.m. by  night time man I hate him
Cause he probably creeping ain’t no proof that he been cheating
So I keep quiet hope that everyone’s lying cuz they telling me rumors but I’m like fuck it he trying
Y'all know niggas ain’t perfect they gone cheat for no purpose
Leave you crying at home next day he blowing up your phone
I can’t resist I take him back, love is blind and that’s a fact
But I see you got everything I need lean on him like he’s codeine
I tell you all my secrets cause I know you keep them
I share with you my dreams cause you help me reach them
I’m in love with your presence cause you make me better
Can’t live without you so I’m praying we just die together
It’s fuck the weather I tell you we been through everything
The only difference is we ain’t wearing no wedding rings
But I’m waiting so patient ain’t no need for rushing
Because I give up the fucking world just to be left with nothing but you you you

Let me just admire you

But I don't trip 'cause it'll be quick and you'll be back for it too
Look, real love I ain't never met that (Yeah)
'Cause they say it's only real if it comes back (Yeah)
But to be real you only coming for feels
Knowin' I let you in I'm knowin' it isn't real but
In the back of my mind i'm thinkin' deeper
Got me hitting notes that ain't even hit by Aretha
Hit her and then you leave her now her mindset is broken
Guess it feels better when my eyes ain't open
'Cause we know what it is when the phone ring (Yeah, yeah)
Faking mad when we know we on the same thing (Oh, no)
Pretend to be in love cause it sound right
Now you gon' disappear for another night
And then you come back with a love story
Say you sorry and you promise that you won't ignore me
Anymore hit the floor it's on
In the morning we wake up and you'll be gone down
It´s a college dorm room and we ain't really doing
Nothing as the time flies by
We might as well save this here for later, rap up on these papers
We can finish once I make you mine
'Cause I don't really know about you, but I ain't never felt so good
I'm hoping this stay's for a while, swear we got that molly love
'Cause once it's gone with the wind, you gon' wanna feel it again
I'm hoping this stay's for a while, swear we got that molly love yeah

A wise man told me the first step towards change is awareness, the second step is acceptance
Are you aware of the changes that are happening around you? Are you willing to accept the change that is upon us?
Cash rules everything around me
Tell them broke boys get the fuck from 'round me
Once it comes it comes, when it leaves it leaves
You ain't 'bout that life, you can't roll with me, no no
Time for a shift, a metamorphosis, a modification, a difference
Once it comes it comes, when it leaves it leaves
You ain't 'bout that life, you can't roll with me, no
Money talks and these bitches is mighty quiet
I hear these niggas woofing, I kill 'em with dead silence
I could reply but there's really no need for payback
My papers just as long as the legroom inside the Maybach
They hate it
Won't find me in no club unless I'm gon' be compensated
Spot right on the beach so when I'm home I'm on vacation
Fuck you doing? Why you never happy?
If that man ain't get the check then that nigga just don't attract me
I'm more into the ballers, don't look at me like I'm Draya
I spend it and I waste it, it's plenty more left for later
These boys can't hang with my clique
You know I keep a bankroll, that won't fold, the same sizes, they dick
I'm in a playful ass mood, you gotta pay for this ride
I make a scene and when I leave, I make 'em stand like the bride
Let's get these rappers on the alter, better pray while they can
I'm comin' heavy as a pound, these niggas still on the gram
I get a kick out of doin' business and living life
You getta' kick outta fuckin' bitches with hella' likes
We in a different state of mind
I ain't never heard the word declined
All I think about is time
I need it around the clock
I need it around the clock
I want you to think Tink
If you not thinking Tink then I'ma say you not thinking
And If you not thinking Tink  then I don't wanna know what you thinking because there's nothing else worth thinking about
Life doesn't get better by chance, it get's better by change
I don't give a fuck about no gossip, they whispering who's better
Man I'm at these niggas throats, and that shit goes for whoever
I'm hoping you get it twisted, don't care if you feel offended
I know that you heard my name, I'm just waiting for you to diss it (Oh yes)
I'ma blow right at your top, John Kennedy
Nothin' I hate more than a nigga with bitch tendencies
That's like 99% of y'all
I tell these niggas bow their heads like I was rappin' out the synagogue
Yahweh pockets on grande
Make him put his face next to my waist and he got down like my fiancée
Shit was 'bout an hour
I need a nigga with some power, movin' forward, Dwight Howard
That's the party, we rollin' like a Harley
I showed up with them bands so every nigga in this club came tardy
We in a different state of mind
I ain't never heard the word declined
All I think about is time
I need it around the clock
I need it around the clock
That change will make your life better is here
Time for a shift
Tink spit that ghetto gospel
Cash rules everything around me
Tell them broke boys get the fuck from 'round me
Once it comes it comes, when it leaves it leaves
You ain't 'bout that life, you can't roll with me, no no

It's like he know I'ma be nothin' without it

Startin' not to believe in love, 'cause I don't really think we're meant to me
Every nigga I tried to date promised that it'd be different
And every time I took a chance, found out he wasn't genuine
I've been through so much and I don't wanna sound emotional
But every time I fall in love, it's something that always goes wrong
People say that I'm gullible for thinkin' that there's someone for me
Even though I'm hurt inside, I ain't givin' up that easily
You don't know what pain is 'til you done had your heart broke
Someone that can comfort me, that's really all I'm lookin' for
Wanna give my trust away, but I don't wanna feel abandoned
When it comes to love, I'm hopeless romantic, 'cause
Maybe I'm naive (Naive), maybe I'm too nice (Too nice)
Maybe I just pick the wrong kind of niggas in my life
Tired of being tired, tossin' in my sleep
Maybe it's my fault for wearin' my heart around my sleeve
Maybe I'm naive (Naive), maybe I'm too nice (Too nice)
Maybe I just pick the wrong kind of niggas in my life
Tired of being tired, tossin' in my sleep
Maybe it's my fault for wearin' my heart around my sleeve
Maybe I'm movin' too fast, I gotta pull it together
Don't wanna hurt any more, I need somebody that know what he wants
Tired of being disappointed, certain things I'm avoidin'
Hold it in 'cause I want a man, but I gotta make better choices
I take 'em back when they wrong (Wrong), I know I'm way too forgivin' (Yeah)
I see the flags and I know the truth, but I always go against it

Can't fuck with em
I'ma let yall know what I mean
See
I love that nigga but he did me wrong
I love that nigga but he led me on
I love that nigga but I can't be jealous
Since I found that evidence up in your phone
You dicking her down
When you dicking me too
Replied to a text like ""I miss you too""
Talking bout the freaky shit that yall gon' do
When just last night you was in my room
You so damn disrespectful
How you gon' do me like this?
I threw you bread when you was low
I paid for all your new fits
I outta spit on this bitch
I'm bout to start up some drama
I let you eat from my crib
Even introduced you to mama
And now you freaking my friend
I had like so many plans
Thought we was one day gon' get married
Honeymooned out in France
But now it's fuck love
Fuck love
You fucking her with no glove
Thought you was a real nigga
Fake shit what you made of
She loves him
She loves him
She loves him
She loves him

They don't give a fuck
The way I feel about it
Why should we? You know what I'm saying

And the next day go fuck your friends
But it's cool tho
It's fuck em
Cause at the end of the day
All you got it yourself man
These niggas don't care
Keep it real tho
You see
And now I'm looking dumb
Did all that record like ""girl he the one""
Told my friends I couldn't wait for a son
When all the while you was having your fun
But it's cool
You ain't gotta worry bout shit no more
My tears gon' dry up
Cause by the time you done with that bitch
And you hit my line
I'll have a new line up
And it's crazy
Invested all my time in something that wasn't even worth it
I gave you my all
Just cause I thought that you deserved it
Guess not
Second chance? No sir
Fucked over my heart
Now it's time for you to just go fuck hers
And now he say I'm bitter
I got that from my next
But really it ain't my fault
I blame this shit up on my ex
And now I'm holding baggage
Can't get rid of these bad habits
Them prep talks ain't useful
Cause now I miss him
And I'll be truthful
I just
I love that nigga
Love will make you do some crazy things
They say I'm
They say I'm stupid but I love that nigga

Love how you fucked up one night
And ready to go back the next day
You feel me?

I’m loving the moment
Tell me that you want it
Boy come get up on it
Cause I know that you're fiending
Let me know you mean it
Words were meant for speaking
Can we talk on the weekends?
Cause lately I've been lonely
Remember what you told me
If you just have the time spend it here with me
Dont worry 'bout your past or my history
Cause that don't even matter when you're here with me
I just want your time
I don't think it's too much to ask from my personal view
If I give you one hundred, then you gotta give me that too
I just want your company, wondering if you want mine
I'm not asking for much...
I just want your time
Time, time, time, time, your time
Time, time, time, time, your time
Think I need a minute
It's been a while since we kicked it
You told me you are with it
So lets link when you touch down
Do you have time for love now?
Tell me tell me patience
It's so hard when I'm waiting, for you

Would you love me, baby, if it all falls down?
If it all falls down
Would you love me, baby, if it all falls down?
If it all falls down
If I fell on my knees, lost everything that I own
Could I rely on you to come through when I called your phone
See plenty people left when they told me they'd stayed forever
That's why I'm not convinced when you tell me that we're together
You could be in my life because I'm famous and on my feet
Would you like me if I was working at CVS up the street
With a nine to five every night and two baby's one month apart
Would I still have your support if I never sold on these charts
That's hypothetical, I love you like my edibles
You hate when I get high, but I'm just feelin' low inside
I've been paranoid, it's colder than North Dakota
Would they still think I'm hot if I drove in this blue Toyota?
I guess you're bottled up so I'm sipping slow while I'm steering
Can't fuck nobody new till I fuck with 'em for they spirit
I need someone who can hold me up until the end
If shit gets real heavy just help me through thick and thin
Would you love me, baby, if it all falls down?
If it all falls down
Would you love me, baby, if it all falls down?
If it all falls down
Plane ride, thinkin' 'bout the places I've been
I need a week away from life to fix the mess that I'm in
Pour up a shot and toss it out for all the people I've lost
I had some energies around me that I had to shake off
Good vibes mean everything to a boss
I went from Nike to Chanel and you don't know what that cost
I had to sacrifice a lot
It's real lonely at the top
How deep is our connection?
You good with imperfections
Would you speak if you blew up and you saw me in your section?
Are you here for the fame?
Are you here for the night?
I wanna buy in but you change every time
I know nothing is guaranteed
I contemplate when you tell me you'll never leave
It's just way outta control
I wanna settle down, but first I gotta know

And not put a fucking freestyle on that bitch
Yall know how I do
Let's get it
I know a couple of niggas
They put a price on your head
They can’t locate your mama
They kill the sister instead
Leave you leaking like faucets
Touch the line but don’t cross it
If a bitch work my nerves
I’ll beat her ass in that office
I’m that bitch in your city
Don’t act like you ain’t know
I dropped a tape in the winter
So fucking cold that it snow
I mean I’m younger than most
But I got plug with the vets
And my loud be so strong
Let me lift that weight of your chest
Like you depressed
Or half dressed
Tell these hoes get it together
Your boyfriend gave me brain
And I must say he’s mighty clever
That GPA is A-Okay
No perfume but he gone spray
Tell your bitch to play your role
‘Cause I got clips just like Zae
Just like me they want to be
Got more shores than beside that sea
Beside that sea I’m grade A
Trucking bitches Chevrolet
I do this shit for fun
Thought you niggas knew
They know my fucking name
Tell me who are you?
Pretty bitch I am one
Competition I been done
Y’all was kicking them baby flows
I was in the lab standing on my toes
Dropping bars like every week
I need a mil like after Meek
Spent a hundred grand on my bed sheets
I ain’t felt it once ‘cause I’m never sleep
All in all I’m energized
Replacing hoes like school supplies
Do this shit for my squad and ‘nem
And I won’t stop like I ain’t see the sign
No time to be wasted
Them choppas out they need braces
I’m a big deal to you little hoes
Like a loud blunt just face it
Street saying I am the best
All these hoes is on house arrest
Y’all ain’t moving
Please don’t confuse me
My niggas bang with no drum kits
We turning head and I won’t brag
But niggas hating like fucking fags
All rappers got to give it a break
Y’all washed up and I done brought the rag
Hating on me just make me proud
Superstar in your fucking town
Whole city putting fingers up
Now the whole city can’t turn me down
Making noise and you got to listen
Swear to god I’m with the gang missing
Injured player
I’m an engineer
And these bitches broke they need fixing
Need a deal
You a damn liar
Advertise me
Who’s flyer?
Me nigga that’s too easy
Sporting J’s like where’s Stevie?
My name is Tink and you can add the G
I’m going in like I found the key
I found my place and I’m in my zone
You niggas scared like y’all home alone
I ride alone and I ride for mine

36264,Tink,Bad Side,"“Bad Side” revolves around a love-and-hate relationship as Tink elaborates that even though he gets on her “last nerve”, she still wants him “here with ”.
Just the other day we had a normal conversation
Now we fighting and he telling me he hates me
Telling me I'm nothing, I just want to love him
Hate it when we fighting and cursing all in the driveway
Now we ain't been talking from Sunday Monday to Friday
I think I should hit you but talking is not an option
Talking is not an option
Goddamn, I'm missing your phone calls
Your body up under mine when it's cold as the wintertime
You treated me wrong, and I treated you foul
But I ain't gon' try to act like I'm over you now
Talking to myself, want to know just how you felt
Are you lonely while I'm gone or did you meet somebody else?
Is she taking care of you? Can't believe we're really through
If you're ever feeling lonely then you know just what to do
Blow me up (Oh now, baby)
Blow me up (ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh)
You been on my bad side
But I ain't gon' act like
I don't want you here with me
You get on my last nerve
But I ain't gon' say a word
'Cause I want you here with me (Baby)
You been on my bad side
But I ain't gon' act like
I don't want you here with me
You get on my last nerve
But I ain't gon' say a word
'Cause I want you here with me (Baby)
Blow me up
Blow me up
Just the other day you was saying this was forever
Now you out here searching and looking for someone better
Tryna make it even, uh
Giving me that silent treatment
Now I'm having questions I'm thinking, ""Why wouldn't you answer?""
I want to know what's up but it's probably too much to handle
I think I should hit you but talking is not an option no more
Goddamn, I'm missing your FaceTime
Your body up under mine when you holding me while I grind
You treated me bad and I treated you wild
But I'm not gon' try to act like I'm over you now
Talking to myself I don't know what else to say
Me and you was super tight and now it's like we night and day
Is she taking care of things? Do you call her by my name?
If you ever need somebody, yeah, my number's still the same
Blow me up, yeah, yeah, yeah
Blow me up, yeah, yeah
You been on my bad side
But I ain't gon' act like
I don't want you here with me
You get on my last nerve
But I ain't gon' say a word
'Cause I want you here with me (Baby)
You been on my bad side

Drop it, drop it, drop it
Drop it, drop it, drop it
20 years old, and she ain't got time to play
Baby daddy gone, money getting low
Mama won't let her stay no more
Stripclub (yeah-yeah)
Now she living at the stripclub
Grew up living in Chicago
Never had love from her father
All she really needed was attention (attention), attention (attention)
Nineteen had a little baby
Dropped out of school just to raise it
Mama said you wanna be grown your on your own
But now she's at red diamond, every weekend she's shinning
Trying to make ends for the kid (no-no, no-no, yeah-yeah)
Paying for tuition with her body
Popping ""X"" pills in the lobby
Don't wanna remember what she did
What she did that night oh-no
20 years old, and she ain't got time to play
Baby daddy gone, money getting low
Mama won't let her stay no more
Stripclub (yeah-yeah)
Now she living at the stripclub (club)
Can't nobody judge you no, no
Make that money don't let that money make you girl
She's climbing up thinking of all the things she could have done else
But whats to do when no one cares and all you have is yourself (ohhh)
20 years old, and she ain't got time to play
Baby daddy gone, money getting low
Mama won't let her stay no more

Love you in the AM; by nighttime man I hate him
Cause he probably creepin’ ain’t no proof that he been cheatin’
So I, keep quiet, hope that everyone’s lyin’
Cause they tellin’ me rumors, but I’m like, fuck it, he tryin’
Y’all know niggas ain’t perfect, they gone cheat for no purpose
Leave you cryin at home, next day he blowin up yo phone
I can’t resist, I take him back
Love is blind and that’s a fact
But I see you got everything I need
Lean on him like he’s Codeine
I tell you all my secrets, cause I know you keep ‘em
I share with you my dreams, cause you help me reach ‘em
I’m in love with your presence, cause you make me better
Can’t live without you so I’m just praying that we die together
It’s fuck the weather, I tell you we been through everything
The only difference is we ain’t wearin no wedding ring
But I’m waitin, so patient, ain’t no need for rushin
Cause I give up the fuckin world just to be left with nothing
But you, you, you…

I don't even wanna, let down

And I'm here in Chicago with uhm, Tink
Client seems very disturbed, extremely emotional at times
Seems to be a lot of, pressure
A lot of pressure on her shoulders
I wanna take this session a little deeper
Uhm, this therapy session is very very important for both me and my client

Knew I was wrong, but I just hate the way you handled it
Could've came to me and addressed it like a real nigga
You set me up and now it's hard for me to deal with you
You cheated on me so I cheated back out of spite
Been bringin' niggas to this crib nearly every night
Didn't mean to hurt you, but you left me hangin' for some years
I played you out and now you finally see how bad it feels
I would let you slide every time when you did your dirt
I asked you why and your reply's ""I was off a Perc""
Been sippin' lean, takin' drugs since you moved to Vegas
We used to talk and now it's like we ain't communicatin'
You shut me out 'cause you embarrassed about all the games
I was the realest, but it's different now, the nigga changed
You seen me off a hunnid times and I never told
And as soon as I get in my bag, that's when niggas fold
I'ma make you feel it now, go 'head and take the bail
You actin' loyal, but on God, you ain't hold it down
And if I'm a thot then you a thot, that's the way it goes
You a snake and you upset 'cause this thing got exposed
I had to hide my deepest feelings when you let me down
Now the only way to be okay is if I mess around
I ain't gon' cry up in no Civic, I'ma go and get it (Go and get it)
You played a part in all this shit and you just can't admit it

I'm on some new shit right now and I don't give a fuck
You know I probably would've flipped if I ain't hear the truth
I knew you had somebody else before I saw the proof
My intuition was on point, that's why I'm alone
Feel like you cheated just to see if I was really strong
I thought you knew me but you really don't know me at all
You done broke my heart, now I regret I even got involved
I don't want no nigga, if that nigga got a million hoes
You been on these bitches so don't worry 'bout who in my phone
I question your intent
You know my life, I'll be alright no matter who I'm with

When I was with you, you ain't care enough to hit me back
I fucked a nigga in Miami I met on the strip
I was in my feelings for a week, that's just how I am
Ain't nobody faithful, it just hit me like an F and N
You say I'm dead to you now and ain't no comin' back

See 'em outside, act like we nevеr met (Never mеt)

I just hope you never leave
Went Dubai to Cancun, I've been fallin' too soon
I treat you like my goon, how you do me so savage?
All 'cause of you, I'm on Mollys and shrooms

Can I trust you with my heart?
And when they throw lies on my name
Will you still treat me the same?
Will you up and leave like everyone in my past?
Smilin' in my face, throwin' shade behind my back
It be your own blood, that'll go out and destroy you
Just 'cause they in your car, doesn't mean they ridin' for you
I done seen my dawgs, dawgs turn vultures

Up like a pilot
The money's so violent
We valet the whip and then run in the spot
Feeling important, too fly like I'm Jordan
A ring cost a mil, that's a real milly rock
Rockin' designer, now we on the meter
Loafs on my feet cost a whole lotta peta
Piece on my hip like a motherfuckin' beeper
Don't let it ring off
Car full of niggas who know how to get you
And do you in minimum time
Run through the bank
And deposit more cake than a baker would bake for her bride
March in the buildin'
They all get filmin' like we got a movie to cut
Shoot out the dealer
I'm hot as a fever the formula white like it's in the Ku Klux
The point is this shit don't really stop
Whole lotta money bein' made

No I want you

Only nigga in Toronto with a felony
On Eastside bitch but I'm tellin' you
And ""you Lil Durk crazy"" what you tellin' me
Yeah, what you tellin' me
Straight out the gutter
I ain't got a shame, people less more (?)
I'm lovin' the way you
And you lovin' the way I
Smell like the money
Since I met you girl, you been 100
Took you from your man and he ain't know nothin'

That these niggas kind of fake
Why these bitches all in my face
When they know I don't Parlay
They know
I'm so used to going H.A.M
I don't really give a damn
Put your fingers up
Okay, hands up with a middle finger
Let 'em know I don't give a fuck
I heard I got a little competition
Therefore she ain't big enough
Big enough
Yo' money ain't
I'm serving hoes
No dinner plates
I'm out here doing my damn thing
So they honor me
I'm like a holiday
Memorials cuz' it's R.I.P
Niggas soft like Warren B
Bitches mad cuz' I'm hitting notes
Now they man calling me Tink G
Tink G but I stay sharp
I keep a bag like a shopping cart
All these haters up on my dick
That condom size about a extra large
T-size like knee highs
I'm coming up and they mad about it
Flexin' on bitches I'm taking they niggas
I drop a few bars now get it shawty
Oops I ain't mean to do that
I'm a beast and I might hurt feelings
But a bitch got to know that I could care less
Middle fingers up to the ceiling
I ain't tryna Parlay
Fuck we need to talk for
I'm just tryna get paid
Call that green shit Rondo
Call these rappers Ceily
All they life they been sneak dissing
A lot of hoes want to be me
So all your life you be reminiscing
Fingers up but it's four missing
Fuck you like a naughty Christian
Tell 'em to get they praise on
Get up on your knees speaking tongues
Speaking in tongues I be spitting this shit that be having these weak bitches ready to quit
Probably the reason why bitches be hating and waiting to comment on all of my shit
Get real
MTV
Two headed dog
Yea that's me
Yes I'm a savage

Are we off or on, I never know
Two weeks left in town and summer's gone
We've been up this hill for a very long time
Made up in my mind
I'm having fun tonight
Pull up and let's go ride
I'm on that modern wave
I'm letting go of this
And there are no regrets
I'm on that modern wave
I bet you think I'm in the house with my mind lost
I'm popping bottles, moving forward, with them brights on
You had your chance to make this fairytale come true but
You changed up your word, that's not how things work
I had to press restart, you have to play your part
I'm on that modern wave
I'm letting go of this
And there are no regrets
I'm on that modern wave
Hands in the sky, it's a modern wave tonight
Can you feel it, can you feel it?
Hands in the sky, it's a modern wave tonight
Can you feel it, can you feel it?
Hands in the sky, it's a modern wave tonight
Can you feel it, can you feel it?

On you, on you

How can I explain?
Every time you cross my mind, it's pressure on my brain (Pressure on my brain)
I'ma zoom in again and I can't figure it out
Why do I always have these doubts?
Oh, no I can't figure it out
But I'm always, always
Callin' you out when you make your mistakes
You said you'd fix shit, but that ain't the case
Tell me what's up 'cause I'm too real to fake it
Came here tonight 'cause I need clarification
So off and on, don't know if you're comin' or goin' (Comin' or goin')
You ain't for me and no I won't pretend
Guess this is where this relationship end
You played me out, another bitch
Had a real onе, but you fumbled it
You fumbled it, you fumbled it
You gon' rеgret how you did me once you see me happy with some other man (Some other man)
You gon' regret how you did me once I put my heart in someone else's hands
'Cause you steppin' on my emotions (Steppin' on my emotions)
And you're way too busy to notice (Way too busy to notice)
That I'm close to walkin' away (Close to walkin' away)
'Cause you're way too arrogant, can't be fair with it
That's the way that you play
I hope my new nigga knows what to do
I been so caught on you, I forgot how it feels
I hope my new nigga fucks me so good, that it feels like I'll never need nobody else
You ain't acknowledge my boundaries
You left me open to choose
I hope my new nigga loves me (Love me)
Loves me better than you (Better than you)
You gon' regret how you did me once you see me happy with some other man
You gon' regret how you did me once I put my heart in someone else's hands

He never call me no bitch
Helped me through all of this shit
He never play with my heart like you
He don't be out with no hoes
Cheatin' and sayin' it's my fault
He never left me alone like you
Dinero, dinero, dinero
Where have you been all my life?
Dinero, dinero, dinero
You make me stay on my grind
Money talks, money talks, never got tired of being faithful
And wishing falls, wishing falls, ain't go time for no labels
He was always around
When you was actin' up, he still held me down
Money talks, money talks, never got tired of being faithful
And my heart is with dinero, dinero, dinero
Dinero, dinero, dinero
He always keeps me goin',  it's good to know he got it
He always feelin' on me, he be deep up in my pockets
And anytime I want it, he say baby go and cop it
And I ain't never worry cause I know just what I got with
That money so loyal  it wait on me til I get home
I want it so bad sometimes I just can't let it go
Benjamin, Benjamin, Benjamin, Benjamin
Ain't nobody else make me feel like this
Dinero, dinero, dinero
Where have you been all my life?

What about praying, what about giving me a chance to explain it

And I missed out on so much that it makes me mad cause I can't live twice
And I wanna get right but I gotta get bread
To live nice and live life and live long

I'm the plug nigga
I plug niggas from out of state
I know drug dealers who drug niggas in broad day
(Sellin' bud nigga, bud nigga, bud nigga
Sorry to inform you all I'm a drug dealer
I'm a...)
Hustler, get my percentages off the top
Suited like Mr. Carter, my niggas is holding rocks
That's a...
(Dope nigga)
I poke niggas like Pillsbury
Robin' them in they hood
Mask on me like Jim Carrey
Got a Spanish boy who don't speak no Ingles
Give him the product, he gone pack it like it's Greenbay
(Nigga I'm a trapstar, trapstar, tr-trapstar hero
Disguised as a rapstar, uh, the flows ghetto
Earth is not my home)
They find me like Bin Laden
ABC tellin' stories, the government steady plottin'
Niggas say they hustle, they in Bugattis
If money ain't comin' quick, we stretch it like some pilates
Go
Always on that come-up, uh, still movin' bass
(still movin' bass, still movin' bass)
Ever seen hustles you don't know about, still movin' bass
(still movin' bass, still movin' bass)
I'm a hustler, take my percentages off the top (I'm a hustler)
(I'm a hustler, take my percentages off the top)
Ima hustler, get my percentages off the top (I'm a hustler)
(I'm a hustler, get my percentages off the top)
I enjoy the workin'
Drug lords and watch boys
Eat or be eaten every season they make a choice
Like Lebron James, niggas switchin for diamond rings
Get that
(Long money, short winded, let's go and get it
It's amazing)
Bang bang
Get to business
( ceilings)
Junkie at the door like Jehovah's Witness
(20 chickens watchin' and I still be movin' that bass
Gave a job to the children you scared to raise)
But my chain swingin'
Now, my name ringin'
My niggas hate new faces so we all racist
(We movin' weight up at a different pace)
2 steps ahead so I lead 'em like I'm T.D. Jakes
(I'm hard to kill Dade County, Versace Hills)
I am the motto
From Dade County up to Chicago
(Only one man got the combination to the safe)
Only woman in the field movin' 'round the bass
Always on that come-up, uh, still movin' bass
(still movin' bass, still movin' bass)
Ever seen hustles you don't know about, still movin' bass
(still movin' bass, still movin' bass)
I'm a hustler, take my percentages off the top (I'm a hustler)

I schoolin' 'em all, I'm rule 'em, I'm runnin' the mid-west
Jet skiing over my wrist, yellow as a piss test
Big black suburbans movin' out through your cities
Big enough for the cheese and poppin' up like it's Philly
Big black machines get wet as a submarine
You fuck with the wrong one, they cook ya like Jimmy Dean
Cookin' up for my nigga while checkin' the weather show
Blowin' at all these bitches so tell 'em to pack a coat
They tell me my shit ain't dope, you wanna feature me, nope
Ain't feelin' any of you niggas, I'm classic as piano, ho
Let the fuckin' record play
Tell them bitches I get back another day
They ain't feedin' me or givin' me a check
Shit I ain't gotta mingle or show 'em respek
These bitches ain't tough, that's cashmere
How you gon' keep up with the shoes that I wore last year?
How you gon' survive when this shit is 9 to 5
And you slippin' out of bounds, you ain't seein' my lines
I see it all the time, these niggas they get comfy
Running with all these niggas a little rusty
Call me Hugh Hef, I'm pimpin' the whole biz
I'm movin' these bitch's Jack to the back like a sew in
And when I get on the beat you can label it a goner
Read over this shit and it's blessed like Eric Garner

Don't shoot
Tell the children to watch out, watch out
Don't shoot
Tell the children to watch out, watch out
Don't shoot
I'm here, I'm putting my life on the line for my people. I'm putting life on the line for everybody in this country. I believe in equality for everybody. And why do cops tell us we can't be like, like you said, we have a right to defend ourselves. Martial Law. They have complete domain over us, they are like Gods. If they tell you not to do something, you cannot do it. And if you do, they will treat you like a dog. You will be shot down. Well at least for a black man. I'm not sure for everybody but I do understand that, I hope it's not like that for everyone
Tell the children to, watch out
Keep runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
They're gainin' on us, oh they're gainin' on us
Keep runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'

Plot twists, just nana, me and the kids
We in the crib, it's a quarter past ten
""Where your brother at?""
Run up in his room, pulled the cover back
Where I'm from niggas leave the porch and they don't make it back
Police light, nana starts pacing
""Fuck the pigs want, what brings you here on this occasion?""
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Boys been gunned down, your boys is having fun now
With our blood and our sons, disturbing the peace
He's more afraid of him when he's the one with the piece?
Aaah, nana drop, she hollering ""Why God?!""
Police be telling us it's nothing but their job
They profile us
Then they wonder why we grow up being prejudice and so violent
It trickles down from the rich to the poor
They'll fuck with you cause they can't believe that it's yours
Registration, I'll give these fucking streets motivation
They wanna take us out so they start making allegations
I'm fed up
Police coming so we sped up
My nana told me ""fuck twelve keep yo' head up""
Tell the children to, watch out
Keep runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
They're gainin' on us, oh they're gainin' on us
Keep runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'

King died for us niggas living in poverty
50 years later we still don't have equality, it bothers me
A badge is a pass to do whatever
So now we living in fear of the people here to protect us
Yo, they lie and disrespect us, kill us, and then neglect us
The problem when nobody sees the view from our perspective
My people shed blood from the acres you had stole
Now my people shedding blood on the gravel left in the cold
How these news anchors talking 'bout the struggle
These niggas had it good, never had a pat down up in their hood
Never had to take a charge, never had to stop the car
Never had to hit the stands so you would never understand
Be one hunnid, I'll meet you at the top just like a summit
My flows are abundant, I'ma make you sound redundant
I really am messiah, bless the whip but  tires
When I'm riding out I hope them crooked niggas see me flying uh

What is we on? I feel it all in my soul, your energy changin'
Niggas be goin' from bitches to bitch and then wonder why I be complainin'
I'm offended
You givin' these women a reason to taunt me
As soon as the money slow down, these niggas run back and be yellin' they sorry
The love'll never be the same (Love'll never be the same)
I hate love cause I know the word be in vain (I know the word be in vain)

Say you is, but you never showed me the proof (Never showed me the proof)

Won't call O-M dawg

Don’t want no pretty guy, that ain’t my type
I want a downtown boy like you
Ain’t nothing like a country boy, dirty slang
Wanna take you home, teach you some things
Don’t want no pretty guy, that ain’t my type
I want a downtown boy like you
Something bout the way you run these streets
You’re well respected, whole club knows your name
And, something bout the way you talk to me
I hear your accent, makes me go insane

Im ready for war

My pockets so deep that they feel like a pore
And I feel like a boss cause I'm gaining
And I'm always going in like its raining
Peep-game like I'm looking through a keyhole
And fuck niggas gone change like a tadpole
But that's good cause I'm still getting paid
Whip so clean, coulda' came with a maid
Came with my crew
But I left with a dude
Then I came in his mouth
Like a dentist approved
Bars nigga, where your bars at?
I know your background just like a car fax
You're a rookie to me, I'm a fuckin' bully
And I pull more strings like a loose hoodie
Its easy
You know that I'm a dog, You pass me that beat, I'ma catch it like a Frisbee
And I got 16s
But ain't none of them sweet
I could never be a star on Disney
Fuck that
Put me on a bus pass
Ain't nobody taking my seat
I generate heat
I don't do A C
And I make more hits then Muhammad Ali
Come crown me
And I'm always up in a booth in a lab cause i know a couple of bitches wanna' down me
But chu' never get that
Gotta hit her in the back

Fuck niggas looking at me thru' the fence
Cops on my phone tryin' to get me out my zone
Got to slow this shit down for this shit to make sense
Can't trust none of you niggas, I'm feelin' paranoid
It can be like any one of you snitchin'
But if anybody asks, I was never around
I think it's time a nigga  outta town
Ok, let's throw it
Bought a Greyhound ticket on the one way
Should've never shown the niggas where the guns stay
I regret I let you niggas into my business
'Cause now he in the jam, yellin' names like he takin' attendance
I got a branch where my hoodie on
I do it Death Row style, niggas betta keep a low profile
Snakes on the pavement
First 48 and man, these niggas already giving statements
Be to yourself, stay to yourself, trust nobody
Trust no-body
After dark, you know what I mean?
Straight up, my closest friends did me in
My closest friends, my homies, people who I done took care of they whole family
I done took care of everything for em, looked out for them, put 'em in the game
Everything! Turned on me!
Fear is stronger than love, remember that
Fear is stronger than love, all the love I gave, didn't mean nothing when it came to fear
So it's all good, but I'm a show you how I always survive, I constantly come back
Ya know what I mean?
Only thing that can kill me, is death, that's the only thing that will ever stop me, is death
And even then my music will live forever
Trust no men here
Not your friends here
Plot and talk
Sleep at night
Play both sides
Streets ain't real
Who the fuck is at my crib at six in the morning?
Bust down the door and then came in without a warning
Couped in the mix, handcuffs on my wrist
Gave me one phonecall so I had to dial Tim
What's up Tink?
Timbaland these niggas is all fakes
They tellin' on they brothers and buildin' 'em up a case
So you gotta get me out man it's time to switch up the route
It's far too many niggas in prison runnin' they mouth
I should've been aware of my surroundings
He a G up in the streets but a hoe up in the county
Should've cut 'em off like Road Rage
Niggas say they love you but somehow they wanna see you in the same cage
Nevermind that, too complex
You my nigga but you don't know where the bond at
Real talk, niggas better hold they own ground
When it all goes down, ain't nobody left around
Be to yourself, stay to yourself, trust nobody
Trust no-body
After dark, you know what I mean?
Straight up, my closest friends did me in

Read More 
Last year around this time we was waking up in the apartment
Convos about condos on a lakefront with our blunts rolled
And we knew that we would make it, spoke it like a language
20 bills, no record deal, and this shit already famous
I had to get up and get it, ain't took a break in a minute
Too busy making a profit, bitches ain't even a topic
Can't count how many times they overlooked me
If only they knew what it took me
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up
I remember when they doubt me, couldn't see me on the list
Now I go to any city club when only paying for the trip
Spending weeks at the sophie, spent a lot up on a rollie
It's feeling like my time, it's feeling like my time
Hate on your life when it's good, Squeak in the back with a wood
Money been goin' around, ain't no more holdin' me down
No, no, no, no—oooo
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up
I had to get up and get it, ain't took a break in a minute
Too busy making a profit, bitches ain't even a topic
So please don't act like you know me
If only you knew what it took me
You can never understand
Till you walked in my shoes you won't never understand
You know
Long talks on my flight home and I'm thinkin' 'how can I make it back?'
Harlems all on my shoulders now and my niggas sayin' I'm too relaxed
Mama trippin', my daddy vision been goin' blind and I'm so behind
I just met up with another nigga cause another woman ran off with mine
Still going through a lot, still tryna get it right
Still thinkin' for whatever reason 'how did I get set up with this life?'
Tell the bookie 'how we lookin'?', couple commas, that's a go
Dedication, being patient, something they could never know
I'm not even doing it for the credit
I'm doing it for the family now
You gotta eat
R&B to the motherfuckin' streets
(Go,) I'm wid it
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up

Bitch, call me back, B
I got some shit to tell you, bitch
I don't even know if I shoulda did that shit
'Cause a bitch damn near
On cloud nine, ya feel me?
I fucking seen Chris ass
I fucking final— I finally went with that nigga
We been fuckin' around on the low-low for a little minute

And I finally went out with him, shit
We went on a nice lil' date an' everything
I ain't gon' lie to you bitch
I fucked that nigga good and he fucked me back, hahahaha
Shit fucking crazy, like, bitch

A good motherfuckin' time
I fuckin' forgot about DeShawn ass, ya feel me
But, the thing with Chris is
Shit, he a card cracker, he always in the motherfuckin' streets
At the club every fuckin' weekend
And you know me, I ain't with that shit 'cause I got a shorty
You know what I'm sayin'

But DeShawn ass be fuckin' bullshittin'

Stupid-ass nigga
But it's cool though
That's why I told yo' ass to call me, bitch, 'cause

And you already know I can't even talk to none of these bitches around here

Or be envious
And I ain't got time for that bullshit
So, bitch, call me the fuck back
