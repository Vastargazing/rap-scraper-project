"""Batch processing endpoints for large-scale lyrics analysis.

Provides asynchronous batch processing capabilities for analyzing multiple
lyrics simultaneously using background tasks. Supports scalable processing
of hundreds or thousands of tracks with progress tracking and status monitoring.

Endpoints:
    POST /batch - Submit batch processing job for multiple lyrics
    GET /batch/{batch_id}/status - Check progress of batch processing job

The batch processing system enables:
- Asynchronous processing without blocking API responses
- Progress tracking with real-time status updates
- Scalable handling of large datasets (100+ tracks)
- Background task management with FastAPI BackgroundTasks
- In-memory job tracking (production would use database/redis)

Features:
- UUID-based batch job identification
- Progress percentage calculation
- Item-level processing with completion tracking
- Error handling and job status persistence
- Configurable batch sizes and processing parameters

Example:
    Submit batch: POST /batch with array of lyrics
    Check status: GET /batch/{batch_id}/status for progress updates

Note:
    In production, batch_jobs dict should be replaced with Redis or database
    for persistence across server restarts and multi-instance deployments.
