- 📊 Baseline metrics for comparison with AI analyzers
- 🗄️ Production-ready component with PostgreSQL integration
- 📈 Detailed composite quality assessments

USAGE:
🖥️ CLI interface:
  python src/analyzers/algorithmic_analyzer.py --stats
  python src/analyzers/algorithmic_analyzer.py --analyze-all --limit 100
  python src/analyzers/algorithmic_analyzer.py --analyze-track 123

📝 Programmatic interface:
  analyzer = AdvancedAlgorithmicAnalyzer()
  result = analyzer.analyze_song("Artist", "Title", "Lyrics...")

DEPENDENCIES:
- 🐍 Python 3.8+
- 🗄️ PostgreSQL with asyncpg
- 📄 PyYAML for configuration
- 🔧 src/interfaces/analyzer_interface.py

RESULTS:
